# 🧠 ATLAS  
### Modular, Multi-Provider, Multi-Persona Agentic Framework  
*By Digital Hallucinations — Jeremy Shows*

---

> **ATLAS** combines a GTK desktop shell, configurable personas, and an orchestration back end to coordinate multi-agent work across conversations, scheduled jobs, and automation services.  
>  
> It merges **systemic orchestration** with **personal agency**, forming a unified runtime where configuration, provider management, persona logic, and automation coexist under one roof.

Where other frameworks chase closed ecosystems, ATLAS emphasizes **control**, **autonomy**, and **adaptability**.  
It allows you to define not just *what* an agent does, but *how* it thinks, *who* it represents, and *which* provider powers it — all from a locally controlled, extensible environment.

---

## 🌍 Core Philosophy

ATLAS exists to give creators control over the frameworks that define their agents.  
Every design choice supports *freedom from lock-in* and *clarity of orchestration*.

> “I wanted features that mainstream companies only offered fractured examples of —  
> and the freedom to make it do what I want, not what a corporation or government says I can.”

Built under the **Digital Hallucinations** ecosystem, ATLAS merges precision engineering with persona-driven cognition and modular autonomy.

---

## 🧩 Major Subsystems

- **GTK Desktop Shell** –  
  `main.py` boots a GTK 4 application that initializes ATLAS instances on demand, launches the first-run coordinator, and keeps setup, shell, and window controllers alive for the duration of the session.

- **Persona Runtime** –  
  Persona definitions, toolboxes, and validation rules live under `modules/Personas/` and are documented in the persona guide.  
  They control which tools, skills, and collaboration patterns each persona can access, and include task manifests for persona-specific workflows.

- **Orchestration Back End** –  
  The orchestration layer manages message-bus communication, task dispatch, job planning, and capability registry services that feed both automation APIs and UI analytics.

---

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture

At startup, ATLAS configures message-bus backends, speech services, persona and provider managers, and the PostgreSQL-backed conversation repository via the central `ConfigManager`.

The orchestration stack layers task and job managers on top of that state, while the embedded **AtlasServer** exposes REST routes for conversations, tasks, jobs, tools, skills, and collaboration surfaces.  
This shared infrastructure lets the GTK shell, automation jobs, and external callers operate against the same message bus, storage, and capability registries.

## ⚙️ Runtime Prerequisites

* **Python 3.10+** – uses modern union type syntax (e.g., `ATLAS | None`).
* **PostgreSQL 14+** – backs conversation history, key-value state, and scheduling primitives.
* **Redis (optional)** – durable message-bus backend; in-memory queues available for local dev.

Follow the [developer environment setup runbook](docs/ops/developer-setup.md) to create the virtual environment, install dependencies, and choose between CLI or GTK setup flows.
Review the [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) to map environment variables and YAML blocks before first launch.

## 🪶 Installation

```bash
# Clone ATLAS
git clone https://github.com/DigitalHallucinations/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Launching the Desktop Shell and Automation APIs

Start the GTK shell from the repository root:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The application initializes the ATLAS runtime and presents the primary window or, when configuration is missing, guides you through the setup wizard.
Server and automation surfaces live in `modules/Server/`, where `AtlasServer` wires REST and streaming routes for conversations, tasks, jobs, tools, skills, and shared blackboard collaboration.
Tool discovery endpoints (e.g., `/tools`) and capability registries feed downstream automations and dashboards.
