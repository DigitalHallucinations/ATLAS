# Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Application Fails to Start

**Symptoms**: Error messages when trying to run the application.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

a) **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_module'`
   - Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

b) **Incorrect Python Version**:
   - Error: `SyntaxError` or unexpected behavior
   - Solution: Verify you're using Python 3.8 or higher. Check with `python --version`

c) **Environment Variables Not Set**:
   - Error: `KeyError: 'SOME_API_KEY'`
   - Solution: Ensure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file

### 2. Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms**: Errors related to database operations.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

a) **MongoDB Not Running**:
   - Error: `ServerSelectionTimeoutError`
   - Solution: Start MongoDB service. On Linux: `sudo systemctl start mongod`

b) **Incorrect Connection String**:
   - Error: `InvalidURI` or connection errors
   - Solution: Verify the `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` in your `.env` file

c) **Network Issues**:
   - Error: Connection timeouts
   - Solution: Check network connectivity and firewall settings

### 3. AI Provider API Errors

**Symptoms**: Errors when generating responses.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

a) **Invalid API Key**:
   - Error: Authentication errors from the AI provider
   - Solution: Verify the API key in your `.env` file

b) **Rate Limiting**:
   - Error: `RateLimitError` or similar
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff or reduce request frequency

c) **Unsupported Model**:
   - Error: Model not found or unsupported
   - Solution: Check the available models for the chosen provider and update your model selection

### 4. High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Application becomes slow or unresponsive, especially with larger models.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

a) **Large Model Loaded**:
   - Solution: Use model quantization or choose a smaller model

b) **Memory Leak**:
   - Solution: Profile the application to identify memory leaks. Use tools like `memory_profiler`

### 5. Slow Response Times

**Symptoms**: Chat responses take a long time to generate.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

a) **Network Latency**:
   - Solution: Check network conditions, consider using a closer API endpoint if available

b) **Inefficient Database Queries**:
   - Solution: Optimize database queries, ensure proper indexing

c) **Resource Constraints**:
   - Solution: Upgrade hardware resources or optimize resource usage

### Q1: How do I add a new AI provider?

A1: To add a new AI provider:
1. Create a new module in the `Providers` directory.
2. Implement the required methods (`generate_response`, `process_response`).
3. Update the `ProviderManager` class to include the new provider.
4. Add the necessary configuration in `config.py` and `.env` file.

### Q2: How can I fine-tune a HuggingFace model?

A2: To fine-tune a HuggingFace model:
1. Prepare your training data in the correct format.
2. Use the HuggingFace Options in the CLI.
3. Select "Fine-tune model" and follow the prompts.
4. Provide the base model, training data, and output directory.
5. Wait for the fine-tuning process to complete.

### Q3: What should I do if I exceed API rate limits?

A3: If you exceed API rate limits:
1. Implement exponential backoff in your requests.
2. Consider using a higher tier API plan if available.
3. Optimize your application to reduce unnecessary API calls.
4. Use caching to store and reuse responses when appropriate.

### Q4: How can I improve the response quality of the AI?

A4: To improve AI response quality:
1. Experiment with different temperature and top_p settings.
2. Provide more context in your prompts.
3. Fine-tune models on domain-specific data if possible.
4. Try different models or providers to find the best fit for your use case.

### Q5: Can I use the chat application in a production environment?

A5: Yes, but consider the following:
1. Implement proper security measures (see Security and Privacy Guidelines).
2. Set up monitoring and logging for production use.
3. Ensure compliance with AI provider terms of service for production use.
4. Implement proper error handling and failover mechanisms.

### Q6: How do I backup and restore the database?

A6: To backup and restore the MongoDB database:
1. Backup: Use `mongodump --uri="your_connection_string" --out=/path/to/backup`
2. Restore: Use `mongorestore --uri="your_connection_string" /path/to/backup`

### Q7: How can I contribute to the project?

A7: To contribute:
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and ensure tests pass.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
5. Follow the Contribution Guidelines in the project documentation.

### Q8: How do I update the application to the latest version?

A8: To update the application:
1. Pull the latest changes from the main repository.
2. Check the Changelog for any breaking changes or new dependencies.
3. Update dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run database migrations if any: `python manage.py db upgrade`.
5. Test the application thoroughly after updating.

### Q9: Can I use multiple AI providers simultaneously?

A9: Yes, the application supports multiple providers:
1. Configure API keys for all desired providers in the `.env` file.
2. Use the CLI to switch between providers as needed.
3. You can implement logic to use different providers for different types of queries if required.

### Q10: How do I handle long conversations with context limits?

A10: To handle long conversations:
1. Implement a sliding window approach, keeping only the most recent messages.
2. Summarize older parts of the conversation to maintain context.
3. Use a database to store full conversation history and retrieve relevant parts as needed.

### Q11: What should I do if I encounter a bug?

A11: If you encounter a bug:
1. Check the Troubleshooting section of this document.
2. Look for similar issues in the project's GitHub Issues.
3. If it's a new issue, create a detailed bug report including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Application logs
   - Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Q12: How can I optimize the application for low-resource environments?

A12: To optimize for low-resource environments:
1. Use smaller AI models or quantized versions of larger models.
2. Implement efficient caching strategies.
3. Optimize database queries and indexes.
4. Use asynchronous programming to maximize resource utilization.
5. Consider deploying on a serverless platform for automatic scaling.
