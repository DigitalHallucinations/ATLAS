# HuggingFace Models Guide

This guide provides detailed information on working with HuggingFace models in the chat application, including model management, fine-tuning, and optimization techniques.

## Working with Local HuggingFace Models

### Loading a Model

1. From the main CLI menu, select "HuggingFace Options".
2. Choose "Load model".
3. Select from installed models or enter a model name from the HuggingFace Hub.

```python
await self.chatbot.provider_manager.load_model(model_name, force_download=force_download)
```

### Unloading a Model

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Unload model".

```python
self.chatbot.provider_manager.huggingface_generator.unload_model()
```

### Viewing Installed Models

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "View available models".

```python
installed_models = self.chatbot.provider_manager.huggingface_generator.get_installed_models()
```

### Removing an Installed Model

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Remove installed model".
2. Choose the model you want to remove.

```python
self.chatbot.provider_manager.huggingface_generator.remove_installed_model(model_name)
```

## Model Fine-tuning Process

Fine-tuning allows you to customize a pre-trained model on your specific dataset.

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Fine-tune model".
2. Provide the following information:
   - Base model name
   - Path to the training data JSON file
   - Output directory for the fine-tuned model
   - Number of training epochs
   - Batch size

```python
await self.chatbot.provider_manager.fine_tune_model(
    base_model, train_data, output_dir, num_train_epochs=epochs, 
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size
)
```

The training data JSON file should have the following format:

```json
[
  {"text": "First training example"},
  {"text": "Second training example"},
  ...
]
```

## Quantization Options

Quantization reduces the precision of the model weights, decreasing memory usage and potentially increasing inference speed.

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Set quantization".
2. Choose from the following options:
   - None (no quantization)
   - 8-bit quantization
   - 4-bit quantization

```python
self.chatbot.provider_manager.set_quantization(quantization)
```

### Impacts of Quantization

- **8-bit quantization**: Reduces model size by about 50% with minimal impact on quality.
- **4-bit quantization**: Reduces model size by about 75% but may have a noticeable impact on quality.

## Best Practices for Model Management

1. **Cache Management**: Regularly clear the model cache to free up disk space.

   ```python
   # Clear model cache
   await self.clear_model_cache()
   ```

2. **Version Control**: Keep track of fine-tuned model versions and their performance.

3. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources (CPU, RAM, GPU) when working with large models.

4. **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, process in batches to manage memory efficiently.

## Advanced HuggingFace Features

### Searching and Downloading Models

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Search and download HuggingFace models".
2. Choose search criteria (by name, task, language, or license).
3. Select a model from the search results to download.

```python
models = await asyncio.to_thread(self.hf_api.list_models, search=search_query, filter=model_filter)
```

### Adjusting Model Settings

Fine-tune generation parameters for better results:

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "Adjust model settings".
2. Modify settings such as temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.

```python
self.chatbot.provider_manager.update_model_settings({'temperature': temperature})
```

### Viewing Model Information

Get detailed information about a model:

1. From the HuggingFace Options menu, select "View model info".

```python
model_info = self.chatbot.provider_manager.huggingface_generator.get_model_info(model_name)
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Errors**: Try using a smaller model or increasing quantization.
2. **Slow Inference**: Check if you're using GPU acceleration, or consider using a smaller/quantized model.
3. **Model Not Found**: Ensure you have an internet connection and the correct model name from the HuggingFace Hub.

By following this guide, you can effectively manage, fine-tune, and optimize HuggingFace models in your chat application, tailoring the AI's performance to your specific needs and resources.
