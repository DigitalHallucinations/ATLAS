### Class: `AnthropicGenerator`

The `AnthropicGenerator` class is responsible for generating responses using the Anthropic AI API, specifically the Claude model. It handles the specifics of interacting with Anthropic's services, including API calls and response processing.

#### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, config_manager: ConfigManager):
    self.config_manager = config_manager
    self.logger = self.config_manager.logger
    self.api_key = self.config_manager.get_anthropic_api_key()
    if not self.api_key:
        self.logger.error("Anthropic API key not found in configuration")
        raise ValueError("Anthropic API key not found in configuration")
    self.client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=self.api_key)
```

The constructor initializes the AnthropicGenerator with a ConfigManager instance, sets up logging, and initializes the Anthropic client with the API key.

#### Key Methods

1. `generate_response(self, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], model: str = "claude-3-opus-20240229", max_tokens: int = 4000, temperature: float = 0.0, stream: bool = True)`:
   - Generates a response using the Anthropic AI API.
   - Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses.
   - Uses retry logic for error handling.

2. `convert_messages_to_prompt(self, messages: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> str`:
   - Converts the standard message format to a prompt string suitable for the Claude model.
   - Handles different message roles (system, user, assistant) appropriately.

3. `process_response(self, response)`:
   - Processes the response from the Anthropic AI API.
   - Concatenates chunks for streaming responses.

### Key Features

- Supports Anthropic's Claude model for text generation.
- Implements retry logic using the `tenacity` library for improved reliability.
- Configurable parameters including model selection, max tokens, and temperature.
- Converts between standard message format and Claude's prompt format.
- Handles both streaming and non-streaming responses.

### Usage Notes

- The class relies on a `ConfigManager` for configuration and logging.
- API key must be properly set in the configuration.
- Error handling is implemented for API call failures.
- The class uses logging to record information and errors during operation.
- The default model is set to "claude-3-opus-20240229", which should be updated if newer versions become available.

### Potential Improvements

1. Implement more comprehensive error handling for different types of API errors.
2. Add support for additional Claude API parameters and features as they become available.
3. Implement a caching mechanism to reduce API calls for repeated queries.
4. Consider adding support for Claude-specific features like multi-turn conversations or specialized prompts.

### Module-level Functions

1. `setup_anthropic_generator(config_manager: ConfigManager)`:
   - A module-level function that creates and returns an AnthropicGenerator instance.

2. `generate_response(config_manager: ConfigManager, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], model: str = "claude-3-opus-20240229", max_tokens: int = 4000, temperature: float = 0.0, stream: bool = True)`:
   - A module-level function that creates an AnthropicGenerator instance and calls its `generate_response` method.
   - Provides a simple interface for generating responses without directly instantiating the class.

3. `process_response(response)`:
   - A module-level function that processes a response by creating an AnthropicGenerator instance and calling its `process_response` method.

These module-level functions provide a simpler interface for setting up the generator, generating responses, and processing responses, which can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application.
