Abstract
Advanced artificial intelligence systems, particularly cognitive architectures aiming for human-like flexibility, must grapple with uncertainty, dynamic environments, and the complex interplay of different types of "value" (e.g., utility, salience, semantic meaning, emotional valence). Current approaches often rely on deterministic or static value representations, limiting adaptability and nuanced reasoning. This paper introduces VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a theoretical framework designed to manage values within AI systems probabilistically and dynamically. VALCORE provides mechanisms for: (1) Representing values as probability distributions or belief states, capturing inherent uncertainty. (2) Dynamically updating these probabilistic values based on new evidence and internal states using principled methods like Bayesian inference or learned recurrent models. (3) Composing complex probabilistic values from simpler constituents via learned functions or probabilistic calculus, enabling synthesis of information under uncertainty. (4) Decomposing complex probabilistic values into their underlying components using techniques like probabilistic factor analysis or learned attribution methods, facilitating analysis, explanation, and credit assignment. We propose VALCORE's integration within cognitive architectures like the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model (HCDM), detailing how it can enhance modules responsible for memory, state representation, decision-making, emotion, and metacognition. By handling values in this flexible, probabilistic manner, VALCORE promises to significantly improve AI adaptability, robustness under uncertainty, contextual reasoning, and explainability.

1. Introduction
1.1. The Limitations of Static, Deterministic Value in AI
Modern AI systems have achieved remarkable feats, yet often operate on simplified assumptions about the 'value' of information, states, or actions. Value representations are frequently deterministic scalars or vectors, assumed to be static or changing only through direct reward signals. This contrasts sharply with biological cognition, where values are nuanced, context-dependent, inherently uncertain, and dynamically constructed. Fixed-value systems struggle with ambiguity, fail to represent confidence levels effectively, and lack the flexibility to adapt value structures as context evolves, hindering progress towards more general and robust artificial intelligence.
1.2. The Need for Probabilistic, Dynamic Value Management in Cognition
Human cognition constantly navigates uncertainty. We maintain degrees of belief, not absolute certainties. The perceived value or importance of goals, objects, or information shifts dynamically based on context, internal state (e.g., mood, fatigue), and ongoing experience. Furthermore, we seamlessly compose complex judgments from uncertain pieces of evidence (e.g., deciding if a situation is dangerous based on multiple ambiguous cues) and decompose complex feelings or decisions to understand their constituent parts (e.g., realizing anxiety stems from specific worries). An AI aiming for human-like adaptability requires mechanisms to emulate this probabilistic, dynamic, compositional, and decompositional nature of value processing.
1.3. Problem Statement: Representing and Reasoning with Uncertain, Evolving Values
The core challenge is developing a computational framework that allows an AI system to: a) Represent diverse types of value (utility, salience, belief, meaning, etc.) not as fixed points but as probabilistic entities capturing uncertainty. b) Dynamically update these probabilistic representations over time based on interactions and internal processing. c) Systematically compose complex probabilistic values from simpler ones, enabling nuanced synthesis. d) Systematically decompose complex probabilistic values into their constituents, enabling analysis, attribution, and explanation. e) Integrate these capabilities seamlessly within a broader cognitive architecture.
1.4. Proposed Solution: The VALCORE Framework
We propose VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a novel theoretical framework designed explicitly for probabilistic and dynamic value management within AI systems. VALCORE provides the conceptual tools and suggests computational mechanisms for representing values as distributions or belief states, updating them dynamically, and performing both value composition (synthesis) and value decomposition (analysis). It is designed to operate across different types of values relevant to cognition.
1.5. Cognitive and Biological Inspiration
VALCORE draws inspiration from several areas:
* Bayesian Brain Hypothesis: Suggests the brain represents beliefs as probability distributions and updates them via Bayesian inference.
* Population Coding: Neural populations often represent variables distributionally, inherently capturing uncertainty.
* Hierarchical Processing: The brain composes complex representations from simpler ones across hierarchical levels.
* Cognitive Appraisal Theories (Emotion): Emotions arise from composing appraisals (evaluations/values) of situations based on goals and beliefs.
* Mental Model Decomposition: Humans decompose complex problems or situations into simpler parts to reason about them.
1.6. Contributions
This paper introduces VALCORE and makes the following contributions:
* Formalizes the concepts of probabilistic dynamic value composition and decomposition in an AI context.
* Outlines potential mechanisms for representing, updating, composing, and decomposing probabilistic values.
* Proposes specific integration strategies for VALCORE within a comprehensive cognitive architecture like HCDM, detailing potential module enhancements.
* Provides a roadmap for implementation and evaluation of the VALCORE framework.
* Establishes VALCORE as a potentially crucial component for developing more adaptive, robust, explainable, and context-aware AI.
2. Theoretical Framework of VALCORE
2.1. Core Concepts: Value, Probability, Dynamics, Composition, Decomposition
VALCORE operates on the principle that 'values' within an AI system are rarely certain and often emerge from combinations of factors or influence multiple outcomes.
 * Value: A quantifiable representation of utility, belief strength, semantic embedding, salience, emotional state component, goal priority, etc. Represented probabilistically.
 * Probability: Uncertainty is explicitly modeled using probability distributions or equivalent formalisms over the value space.
 * Dynamics: Values and their underlying representations evolve over time based on evidence, internal computation, and context shifts.
 * Composition: Mechanisms for synthesizing a composite probabilistic value V_C from a set of constituent probabilistic values \{V_1, V_2, ..., V_n\}. V_C = \text{Compose}(\{V_i\}, \text{Context}).
 * Decomposition: Mechanisms for analyzing a composite value V_C to infer properties of its constituents or attribute the value to its sources. \{V_i\}' = \text{Decompose}(V_C, \text{Context}).
2.2. Probabilistic Value Representation
Choosing the right representation is crucial. VALCORE can potentially accommodate:
 * 2.2.1. Parametric Distributions: Simple and efficient for well-behaved uncertainties.
   * Gaussian: V \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) for continuous values. Mean \mu represents the expected value, covariance \Sigma represents uncertainty and correlations.
   * Beta: V \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) for values in [0, 1] (e.g., probabilities, relevance scores).
   * Dirichlet: V \sim \text{Dir}(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_K) for distributions over K categories.
 * 2.2.2. Non-Parametric Representations: More flexible for complex or multimodal uncertainties.
   * Monte Carlo Samples: Representing P(V) by a set of samples \{v_1, ..., v_S\}. Composition/decomposition might involve operations on these sample sets.
   * Histograms/Discretized Distributions: Approximating P(V) over discrete bins.
 * 2.2.3. Latent Variable Models: Representing the distribution implicitly via a latent code z.
   * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): An encoder maps input context to parameters of a latent distribution q(z|\text{context}), and a decoder maps samples z \sim q(z) to the parameters of the value distribution P(V|z). Composition/decomposition might occur in the latent space z.
   * Normalizing Flows: Transforming a simple base distribution (e.g., Gaussian) into a complex value distribution via learned invertible functions.
2.3. Dynamic Value Update Mechanisms
How P(V | \text{Evidence}_t) evolves over time:
 * 2.3.1. Bayesian Inference and Filtering: Principled updates based on Bayes' theorem: P(V|\text{new evidence}) \propto P(\text{new evidence}|V) P(V|\text{old evidence}).
   * Conjugate priors allow for exact analytical updates if models are simple.
   * Approximate methods (MCMC sampling, Variational Inference) are needed for complex models.
   * Sequential updates can use Kalman Filters (for linear-Gaussian systems) or Particle Filters (for non-linear/non-Gaussian).
 * 2.3.2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers can be trained to directly output the parameters of P(V_t) based on previous parameters P(V_{t-1}) and new input x_t. \text{params}(P(V_t)) = \text{RNN}(\text{params}(P(V_{t-1})), x_t). Requires careful design to ensure valid probability distributions.
 * 2.3.3. Influence of Context and Internal State: Update rules can be modulated by attention mechanisms (weighting evidence), neuromodulatory signals (affecting learning rates or distribution variance), or executive control signals.
2.4. Value Composition Engine
Synthesizing V_C from \{V_i\}:
 * 2.4.1. Formalisms:
   * Bayesian Networks: If components V_i are nodes in a causal graph leading to V_C, inference calculates P(V_C | \{V_i\}).
   * Probabilistic Logic: Rules define how probabilities of component values combine (e.g., P(A \land B) from P(A), P(B)).
   * Fuzzy Logic: Combining degrees of membership or truth values.
 * 2.4.2. Neural Composition Functions: Train neural networks f_{\text{compose}} such that \text{params}(P(V_C)) = f_{\text{compose}}(\{\text{params}(P(V_i))\}; \text{Context}). Attention mechanisms can learn to weight the importance of different V_i.
 * 2.4.3. Handling Dependencies: Simple combination rules often assume independence. More advanced methods must model correlations between component values (e.g., using multivariate distributions, copulas, or learned graph structures).
2.5. Value Decomposition Engine
Analyzing V_C to understand \{V_i\}:
 * 2.5.1. Formalisms:
   * Probabilistic Factor Analysis/PCA/ICA: If V_C is a high-dimensional vector distribution, find underlying independent component distributions V_i.
   * Mixture Models (e.g., GMMs): Model P(V_C) as a weighted sum of simpler component distributions P(V_i), inferring the components and weights. P(V_C) = \sum w_i P(V_i).
 * 2.5.2. Neural Decomposition Functions: Train neural networks f_{\text{decompose}} such that \{\text{params}(P(V_i))\}' = f_{\text{decompose}}(\text{params}(P(V_C)); \text{Context}). This could involve autoencoder-like structures where the bottleneck represents components.
 * 2.5.3. Generating Explanations: Attribution methods (like SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, adapted for probabilistic inputs/outputs) can identify which input components V_i most influence the parameters (e.g., mean or variance) of the composed value V_C. This directly supports explainability.
2.6. Mathematical Grounding (Illustrative Example: Combining Gaussian Beliefs)
Assume two independent components V_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2) and V_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2). A simple linear composition could be V_C = aV_1 + bV_2. The resulting distribution is V_C \sim \mathcal{N}(a\mu_1 + b\mu_2, a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2). A more complex composition might involve learned functions a(\text{context}), b(\text{context}) or non-linear combinations requiring approximation methods (e.g., using sampling or variational inference for the resulting distribution). Bayesian combination for estimating a shared parameter \theta given evidence V_1, V_2 involves P(\theta|V_1, V_2) \propto P(V_1|\theta)P(V_2|\theta)P(\theta).
3. Integrating VALCORE within the HCDM Architecture
VALCORE is not proposed as a single module but as a set of principles and mechanisms potentially enhancing multiple HCDM modules.
3.1. General Integration Principles
 * Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB): Modules post probabilistic value representations (e.g., distribution parameters, samples) to the NCB instead of deterministic values. Other modules read these distributions.
 * Dynamic Attention Routing (DAR): The DAR agent's state includes uncertainty metrics (e.g., variance of key value distributions). Its actions could involve routing information to reduce uncertainty or allocating resources based on expected value and risk (variance).
 * NEST Augmentation: NEST could potentially propagate correlations between the uncertainties associated with different values across the NCB, allowing for faster convergence of global belief states.
3.2. Module-Specific Enhancements:
 * 3.2.1. VALCORE in EMM: Memory relevance scored as P(\text{Relevant}|Query, Context) \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta). Composition combines relevance scores from multiple query features. Decomposition identifies features contributing most to high/low relevance probability. Confidence in retrieved memory content also represented probabilistically.
 * 3.2.2. VALCORE in DSSM: State representations h_t become parameters of P(\text{State}_t). Transition dynamics P(\text{State}_{t+1}|\text{State}_t, \text{Action}_t) are explicitly modeled. VALCORE decomposition could analyze likely state sequences leading to an observed outcome.
 * 3.2.3. VALCORE in ELM: Word/sentence embeddings incorporate uncertainty (e.g., Gaussian embeddings). VALCORE composition models how meaning distributions combine syntactically/semantically. Decomposition helps resolve ambiguity by finding the most likely component meanings given context.
 * 3.2.4. VALCORE in EMoM: Emotional state represented by distributions over Valence, Arousal, Dominance. VALCORE composes appraisals of stimuli/events to update these emotional state distributions. Motivational drive for goals represented by distributions over expected utility; VALCORE decomposes goal values into sub-goal requirements.
 * 3.2.5. VALCORE in EFM: Tasks/goals in the planning queue have associated distributions over priority/utility/completion time. VALCORE composes these to evaluate complex plans. Decomposition explains why a plan was chosen (e.g., high expected utility despite high variance).
 * 3.2.6. VALCORE in AGM: Policy \pi(a|s) is explicitly a probability distribution. Action values Q(s,a) are represented as distributions P(Q|s,a). VALCORE composition might combine Q-value distributions from different models (ensemble). Decomposition attributes value to state features.
 * 3.2.7. VALCORE in SCM: Theory of Mind involves representing other agents' beliefs/goals as probability distributions P(\text{Belief}_{\text{other}}|\text{Observations}). VALCORE composes observed behaviors to infer these mental state distributions.
 * 3.2.8. VALCORE in EMetaM: Monitors the uncertainty (variance, entropy) of value distributions across HCDM. Confidence in predictions is explicitly represented as a probability P(\text{Correct}). VALCORE decomposition helps EMetaM identify sources of high system uncertainty.
 * 3.3. Interaction with Neuromodulatory System (NS): NS signals (simulating dopamine, serotonin etc.) could directly modulate VALCORE parameters: e.g., dopamine increases mean expected value, serotonin decreases variance/uncertainty, acetylcholine sharpens attention for composition.
4. Implementation Strategies and Potential Algorithms
4.1. Data Structures for Probabilistic Values:
 * Use dedicated objects encapsulating distribution type and parameters (e.g., GaussianValue(mean_tensor, cov_tensor)).
 * Leverage libraries like TensorFlow Probability, PyTorch Distributions, Pyro, NumPyro for distribution manipulation and sampling.
4.2. Neural Network Architectures:
 * Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs): Learn distributions over network weights, naturally producing probabilistic outputs. Can implement VALCORE functions.
 * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Learn latent spaces representing distributions over values; composition/decomposition can occur in latent space.
 * Normalizing Flows: Learn complex distributions by transforming simple ones; useful for representing complex value landscapes.
 * Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Ideal if values are associated with nodes/edges in a graph (e.g., knowledge graph, causal graph) and composition/decomposition depends on graph structure.
 * Transformers: Can be adapted to operate on sequences of distribution parameters, modeling temporal dynamics of probabilistic values.
4.3. Learning Paradigms:
 * Variational Inference (VI): Primary tool for training models with latent probabilistic representations (VAEs, BNNs). Maximize Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).
 * Reinforcement Learning (RL): Train agents (like DAR or components within EFM/AGM) to make optimal decisions involving VALCORE's probabilistic values (e.g., balancing expected value and uncertainty). Learn optimal composition/decomposition strategies.
 * Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): Define pretext tasks for learning VALCORE functions, e.g., predict component distributions given the composed one (decomposition), or predict composed distribution given components (composition).
4.4. Computational Considerations:
 * Operating on distributions is more costly than scalars/vectors. Need efficient implementations.
 * Sampling (for non-parametric methods or VI) introduces stochasticity and requires multiple runs for stable estimates.
 * Gradient estimation through probabilistic components can be challenging (reparameterization trick, score function estimator).
5. Evaluation Strategy
Evaluating VALCORE requires assessing both its internal probabilistic consistency and its impact on downstream tasks within HCDM.
5.1. Metrics for Probabilistic Accuracy:
 * Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL): Measures how well the predicted distribution matches observed data.
 * Expected Calibration Error (ECE): Measures if predicted probabilities match empirical frequencies (are confidence levels accurate?).
 * Brier Score: Measures accuracy of probability predictions for discrete outcomes.
 * KL Divergence / Wasserstein Distance: Measures difference between predicted and true distributions (if known).
5.2. Metrics for Composition/Decomposition Quality:
 * Reconstruction Error: Can the decomposition process accurately reconstruct the original composed value or its statistics?
 * Component Identification Accuracy: In synthetic tasks with known ground truth components, how well does decomposition identify them?
 * Attribution Faithfulness: Do explanations generated by decomposition accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning (requires specific testing protocols)?
5.3. Task-Based Evaluation:
 * Design specific tasks requiring reasoning under uncertainty: probabilistic planning, diagnosis, decision-making with partial information. Compare VALCORE-enhanced HCDM to baselines.
 * Measure performance, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise/ambiguity.
5.4. Evaluation within HCDM:
 * Conduct ablation studies: Disable VALCORE mechanisms in specific modules and measure performance drop on relevant HCDM benchmarks (e.g., CompACT sub-tasks).
 * Analyze internal dynamics: Does VALCORE lead to more stable/adaptive internal value representations?
5.5. Explainability Assessment:
 * Evaluate the quality, coherence, and usefulness of explanations generated via VALCORE decomposition through human studies or automated metrics (if applicable).
6. Discussion
6.1. Expected Advantages of VALCORE:
 * Robustness: Explicit uncertainty modeling improves handling of noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete information.
 * Adaptability: Dynamic updates allow values to adjust to changing contexts and evidence.
 * Explainability: Decomposition mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by attributing complex values to their sources.
 * Nuanced Reasoning: Enables more sophisticated reasoning that considers likelihoods and confidence levels, moving beyond simple deterministic logic.
 * Improved Decision-Making: Allows for risk-aware decisions by considering both expected value and uncertainty (variance).
6.2. Challenges and Limitations:
 * Computational Cost: Manipulating distributions is inherently more expensive than scalar/vector operations.
 * Scalability: Applying VALCORE principles across a large architecture like HCDM requires efficient implementations and potentially approximations.
 * Learning Complexity: Training models to effectively learn probabilistic representations and composition/decomposition functions is non-trivial.
 * Theoretical Soundness: Defining universally applicable and mathematically sound composition/decomposition rules for arbitrary distributions and dependencies is difficult. Choosing appropriate probabilistic models is key.
6.3. Comparison with Related Work:
 * Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL): Focuses on uncertainty in model parameters/outputs, VALCORE focuses on uncertainty in internal value representations and their dynamic structuring.
 * Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs): Provide tools for building probabilistic models; VALCORE could potentially be implemented using PPLs but is conceptualized as an integrated architectural framework.
 * Explainable AI (XAI): VALCORE's decomposition directly contributes to XAI by providing model-based explanations.
 * Cognitive Science Models: VALCORE aligns with Bayesian cognitive science theories but aims for a computationally implementable framework within a broader AI architecture.
6.4. Potential Applications Beyond Cognitive Architectures:
 * Finance: Probabilistic risk assessment, portfolio optimization under uncertainty.
 * Robotics: Robust planning and navigation in uncertain environments.
 * Medical Diagnosis: Combining uncertain diagnostic indicators, decomposing symptoms to potential causes.
 * Recommendation Systems: Modeling user preference uncertainty and composing recommendations.
7. Future Directions
 * Hierarchical VALCORE: Applying composition/decomposition recursively across multiple levels of abstraction.
 * Causal VALCORE: Integrating causal inference to learn causal relationships during decomposition, not just correlational factors.
 * Hardware Acceleration: Designing specialized hardware (e.g., probabilistic processing units) to efficiently implement VALCORE operations.
 * Embodied VALCORE: Exploring how sensorimotor interaction shapes the dynamic probabilistic values within an embodied agent.
 * Alternative Probabilistic Paradigms: Investigating fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, or possibility theory as alternatives/complements to standard probability for representing certain types of uncertainty.
 * Learning VALCORE Structures: Developing methods for the AI to learn the optimal way to compose/decompose values for a given task, rather than relying solely on predefined structures.
8. Conclusion
VALCORE offers a novel perspective on managing value within complex AI systems, moving beyond traditional static and deterministic representations. By embracing probabilistic modeling, dynamic updates, and explicit mechanisms for value composition and decomposition, the framework holds significant potential for enhancing the adaptability, robustness, reasoning capabilities, and explainability of cognitive architectures like HCDM. While substantial theoretical and implementation challenges remain, VALCORE provides a rich conceptual foundation for exploring how AI can reason more effectively under the uncertainty inherent in complex, dynamic worlds, bringing us closer to the flexibility and nuance of biological cognition. Its development represents a key research direction for next-generation artificial intelligence.
