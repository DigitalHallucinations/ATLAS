Abstract: Advanced artificial intelligence systems, particularly cognitive architectures striving for human-like cognitive flexibility, must navigate pervasive uncertainty, operate within dynamic environments, and manage the complex interplay of multifaceted "values" (e.g., utility, salience, semantic certainty, emotional valence). Prevailing approaches often employ deterministic or static value representations, which inherently limits adaptability, nuanced reasoning under uncertainty, and robust decision-making. This paper introduces VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a comprehensive theoretical framework for the probabilistic and dynamic management of values within cognitive architectures. VALCORE specifies mechanisms for: (1) Representing diverse values as probability distributions or belief states, thereby explicitly capturing inherent uncertainty and confidence. (2) Dynamically updating these probabilistic value representations based on new evidence and internal cognitive states using principled Bayesian methods or learned recurrent models. (3) Composing complex, higher-order probabilistic values from simpler constituents via learned functions or probabilistic calculus, enabling sophisticated synthesis of information under uncertainty. (4) Decomposing complex probabilistic values into their underlying components or attributing them to generative sources using techniques such as probabilistic factor analysis or learned attribution methods, facilitating analysis, explanation, and credit assignment. We detail VALCORE's proposed integration within the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model (HCDM), illustrating how it can systematically enhance core cognitive modules. By endowing AI with the capacity to handle values in this flexible, probabilistic manner, VALCORE promises significant improvements in adaptability, robustness under uncertainty, contextual reasoning, and inherent explainability, crucial steps towards more general and human-like artificial intelligence.

1. Introduction
The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) necessitates systems that can emulate the adaptability, robustness, and nuanced reasoning characteristic of human cognition. A fundamental aspect of such cognition is the pervasive and sophisticated handling of "value" in its myriad forms—utility, salience, semantic meaning, emotional significance, goal priority, and belief strength. Humans do not operate with absolute certainties; rather, they maintain degrees of belief, dynamically update valuations based on evolving contexts and internal states, compose complex judgments from uncertain evidence, and decompose intricate feelings or decisions to understand their origins (Gershman, 2015; Tenenbaum et al., 2011).

Current AI systems, despite remarkable achievements in specialized domains, often fall short in this regard. Value representations are frequently deterministic scalars or static vectors, changing primarily through direct reward signals (Sutton & Barto, 2018). This limits their ability to: (a) represent and reason about uncertainty explicitly, (b) adapt value structures to novel contexts dynamically, (c) synthesize complex, multi-faceted values from simpler, uncertain components, and (d) provide transparent explanations for how values are derived and influence behavior. These limitations pose significant barriers to achieving more flexible, robust, and generalizable AI.

To address these lacunae, we propose VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a theoretical framework designed for the principled management of probabilistic and dynamic values within cognitive architectures. VALCORE is not a standalone algorithm but a set of architectural principles and computational mechanisms that enable an AI system to:

* Represent diverse types of value as probabilistic entities (e.g., probability distributions, belief states), explicitly encoding uncertainty and confidence.

* Dynamically update these probabilistic representations over time based on new sensory evidence, internal processing, and contextual shifts, employing methods like Bayesian inference or learned recurrent models.

* Systematically compose complex probabilistic values from simpler constituents through learned functions or probabilistic calculus, enabling nuanced synthesis under uncertainty.
* Systematically decompose complex probabilistic values into their underlying components or attribute them to generative sources, facilitating analysis, credit assignment, and intrinsic explainability.
This paper makes the following contributions:
* Formalization of a theoretical framework (VALCORE) for probabilistic, dynamic value representation, update, composition, and decomposition within cognitive architectures.
* Detailed specification of potential computational mechanisms, including parametric and non-parametric distributional representations, Bayesian and neural update rules, and formalisms for value composition and decomposition.
* A comprehensive integration strategy for VALCORE within the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model (HCDM) (Shows, [Date of HCDM Publication, assumed]), demonstrating module-specific enhancements.
* A discussion of implementation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and the potential advantages and challenges of the VALCORE framework.

The VALCORE framework aims to provide a crucial layer of cognitive processing that we argue is essential for developing AI systems capable of more human-like reasoning, adaptability, and explainability in complex, uncertain, and dynamic environments.
2. Related Work
VALCORE draws inspiration from and aims to synthesize concepts from several distinct but related fields:

* Cognitive Architectures: Frameworks like ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004), Soar (Laird, 2012), LIDA (Franklin et al., 2013), and Sigma (Rosenbloom et al., 2016) have long sought to model human cognition by integrating multiple cognitive functions. While some architectures incorporate notions of utility or activation, VALCORE's explicit focus on representing all forms of value probabilistically and providing general mechanisms for their dynamic composition/decomposition offers a more systematic approach to uncertainty management than typically found. HCDM, the target architecture for VALCORE, already emphasizes dynamic, integrated cognition, making it a suitable testbed.

* Probabilistic AI and Machine Learning:

  * Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL): BDL introduces uncertainty into deep neural networks, either over weights (e.g., Bayes-by-Backprop, (Blundell et al., 2015)) or by learning functions that output distributional parameters (Kendall & Gal, 2017). VALCORE leverages BDL techniques for implementing its probabilistic value representations and update mechanisms but situates them within a broader architectural context of value transformation.

  * Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs): PPLs like Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017), Pyro (Bingham et al., 2019), and TensorFlow Probability (Dillon et al., 2017) provide powerful tools for defining and performing inference in probabilistic models. VALCORE's mechanisms could be implemented using PPLs, but VALCORE itself is an architectural blueprint rather than a specific language.

  * Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL): DRL explicitly models the distribution of returns (Q-values) rather than just their expectation (Bellemare et al., 2017; Dabney et al., 2018). VALCORE adopts this principle for action values within AGM (HCDM's Action Generation Module) and generalizes it to other types of values.

* Explainable AI (XAI): Many XAI methods are post-hoc techniques applied to black-box models (e.g., LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017)). VALCORE’s value decomposition engine aims to provide intrinsic explainability by design, attributing composed values to their constituent probabilistic sources. This aligns with model-based XAI approaches.

* Neuroscience and Cognitive Science:
  * Bayesian Brain Hypothesis & Predictive Coding: These theories posit that the brain represents information probabilistically and continuously updates these representations based on prediction errors (Knill & Pouget, 2004; Friston, 2010). VALCORE directly operationalizes these ideas for value representations within an AI architecture.

  * Appraisal Theories of Emotion: These theories suggest emotions arise from evaluating (appraising) situations based on their relevance to goals, coping potential, etc. (Scherer et al., 2001). VALCORE’s composition mechanism within EMoM (HCDM's Emotional Motivational Module) can be seen as a computational instantiation of appraisal processes leading to probabilistic emotional states.

  * Decision Theory & Prospect Theory: These fields study how choices are made, often involving subjective values and risk attitudes (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). VALCORE enables the representation of subjective utilities as distributions and decision-making that considers both expected value and uncertainty (variance, skewness).

VALCORE distinguishes itself by providing a unified architectural framework for these diverse probabilistic concepts, focusing specifically on the lifecycle of "value" within a cognitive system.
3. The VALCORE Framework
VALCORE is founded on the principle that values within an AI system are rarely known with certainty and often arise from, or contribute to, complex interactions.
3.1. Core Principles

* Value (V): A quantifiable representation of utility, belief strength, semantic certainty, salience, an emotional state component, goal priority, etc. Critically, V is not a point estimate but a probabilistic quantity.

* Probability (P(V)): Uncertainty is explicitly modeled using probability distributions or equivalent belief representations over the space of V. This allows for quantification of confidence, ambiguity, and risk.

* Dynamics (\frac{dP(V)}{dt}): The probabilistic representation P(V) evolves over time based on new evidence \mathcal{E}, internal cognitive operations, and contextual shifts C. Updates are governed by principled mechanisms.

* Composition (P(V_C) = \mathcal{F}_{\text{comp}}(\{P(V_i)\}_{i=1}^n, C)): Mechanisms for synthesizing a composite probabilistic value P(V_C) from a set of constituent probabilistic values \{P(V_i)\}. The composition function \mathcal{F}_{\text{comp}} can be fixed (e.g., probabilistic calculus) or learned, and is context-dependent.

* Decomposition (\{P(V_i)'\} \approx \mathcal{F}_{\text{decomp}}(P(V_C), C)): Mechanisms for analyzing a composite value P(V_C) to infer properties of its (latent or explicit) constituents \{P(V_i)'\} or attribute V_C to its sources. This facilitates explanation and credit assignment.

3.2. Probabilistic Value Representations (P(V))
The choice of representation for P(V) depends on the nature of the value, computational constraints, and desired expressiveness. VALCORE accommodates:

* 3.2.1. Parametric Distributions: Efficient for well-characterized uncertainties.
  * Gaussian Distribution: V \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) for continuous, unbounded values (e.g., state variables in DSSM, semantic embeddings in ELM). \mu \in \mathbb{R}^d is the mean vector, \Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} is the covariance matrix.

  * Beta Distribution: V \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) for V \in [0,1] (e.g., probabilities, relevance scores in EMM, confidence in EMetaM). \alpha, \beta > 0.

  * Dirichlet Distribution: V \sim \text{Dir}(\vec{\alpha}) for V being a probability vector over K categories, \sum_{k=1}^K V_k = 1 (e.g., action selection probabilities in AGM, discrete emotional state probabilities in EMoM). \alpha_k > 0.

  * Von Mises-Fisher Distribution: V \sim \text{vMF}(\mu, \kappa) for directional data on a hypersphere \|V\|=1 (e.g., attention vectors in AAN). \mu is the mean direction, \kappa is the concentration.

  * Other relevant families: Gamma (for positive continuous values like expected utility), Student's t (for heavy-tailed continuous values).

* 3.2.2. Non-Parametric Representations: More flexible for complex, multimodal, or arbitrarily shaped uncertainties.

  * Monte Carlo Samples: P(V) represented by a set of S samples \{v_s\}_{s=1}^S drawn from P(V). Operations are performed on these samples.

  * Kernel Density Estimators (KDE): P(V) = \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^S K_h(V - v_s), where K_h is a kernel function with bandwidth h.

  * Quantile Representations/Implicit Distributions: Representing the distribution by its quantiles or via a set of particles (as in Particle Filters).

* 3.2.3. Latent Variable Models (LVMs): The distribution P(V) is defined implicitly via a lower-dimensional latent variable z \sim P(z) and a generative function V = g(z, \text{context}).

  * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): An encoder q_\phi(z|X) approximates the posterior over latents given some input X (e.g., context), and a decoder p_\theta(V|z) generates the parameters of P(V|z) or samples V. X could be the raw input that V is a value for.

  * Normalizing Flows: V = f_K \circ \dots \circ f_1(z), where z \sim P_0(z) (simple base distribution, e.g., Gaussian) and f_k are learned invertible transformations. P(V) can be calculated via change of variables formula.

  * Gaussian Processes (GPs): V(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x')). Represents a distribution over functions. Useful for modeling value functions Q(s,a) in AGM or utility landscapes in EFM, providing uncertainty estimates for unvisited regions.

3.3. Dynamic Value Update Mechanisms (P_t(V) \rightarrow P_{t+1}(V))
Values evolve based on new evidence \mathcal{E}_t and context C_t.

* 3.3.1. Bayesian Inference: Based on Bayes' theorem: P(V|\mathcal{E}_t, C_t) \propto P(\mathcal{E}_t|V, C_t) P(V|\mathcal{E}_{t-1}, C_t).

  * Conjugate Priors: If P(V|\mathcal{E}_{t-1}) (prior) and P(\mathcal{E}_t|V) (likelihood) form a conjugate pair, the posterior P(V|\mathcal{E}_t) has a closed-form analytical solution. (e.g., Beta-Bernoulli, Gaussian-Gaussian).

  * Approximate Inference: For non-conjugate models or high dimensions:

    * Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Sampling methods (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to approximate the posterior. Computationally intensive.

    * Variational Inference (VI): Approximate P(V|\mathcal{E}_t) with a simpler distribution Q(V;\lambda) by minimizing KL(Q(V;\lambda) || P(V|\mathcal{E}_t)).

  * Sequential Bayesian Filtering:

    * Kalman Filters (and extensions like EKF, UKF): Optimal for linear-Gaussian state-space models. DSSM could use these if states V=s_t are Gaussian. P(s_t|s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}), P(o_t|s_t).

    * Particle Filters (Sequential Monte Carlo): Represent P(V_t) with samples (particles) which are propagated and reweighted. Suitable for non-linear, non-Gaussian dynamics.

* 3.3.2. Recurrent Neural Models: RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) can be trained to directly output the parameters \theta_{P(V_t)} of P(V_t) based on previous parameters \theta_{P(V_{t-1})}, new input x_t, and context C_t:

   \theta_{P(V_t)} = f_{\text{RNN}}(\theta_{P(V_{t-1})}, x_t, C_t; W_{\text{RNN}}).
   Requires careful architectural design and loss functions (e.g., minimizing negative log-likelihood of observed data under the predicted distribution) to ensure valid probability distributions.

* 3.3.3. Contextual and Neuromodulatory Influence:

  * Attentional Modulation (AAN): Attention mechanisms can gate or weight the influence of different pieces of evidence \mathcal{E}_t or components of context C_t in the update rule.

  * Neuromodulatory System (NS): Signals from NS (simulating dopamine, serotonin, etc.) can dynamically alter update parameters (e.g., learning rates \eta, prior strengths, variance scaling in \Sigma). For example, P_t(V) update rule might have \eta_t = \text{NS_signal_t} \cdot \eta_0.

  * Executive Control (EFM): EFM can initiate belief updates, set precision targets for certain P(V), or switch between different update models based on strategic goals.

3.4. Value Composition Engine (P(V_C) = \mathcal{F}_{\text{comp}}(\{P(V_i)\}, C)) Synthesizing a composite probabilistic value P(V_C) from a set of constituent probabilistic values \{P(V_i)\}.

* 3.4.1. Formalisms for Composition:

  * Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs): If V_C causally depends on \{V_i\} as defined in a Bayesian Network or Markov Random Field, P(V_C | \{P(V_i)\}) can be inferred.

  * Probabilistic Logic / Arithmetic: Combining probabilities via logical rules (e.g., P(A \land B) from P(A), P(B), P(A|B)) or arithmetic operations on random variables (e.g., V_C = V_A + V_B, then P(V_C) is the convolution of P(V_A) and P(V_B) if independent). If V_A \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_A, \sigma_A^2), V_B \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_B, \sigma_B^2), then V_A+V_B \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_A+\mu_B, \sigma_A^2+\sigma_B^2) if independent.

  * Fuzzy Set Operations: For combining linguistic values or degrees of membership using t-norms and t-conorms if values represent fuzzy uncertainties.

  * Copula Functions: To model complex dependencies between \{P(V_i)\} when composing them, allowing for flexible marginal distributions while defining their joint behavior. P(V_1, \dots, V_n) = C(F_1(V_1), \dots, F_n(V_n)), where F_i are marginal CDFs and C is the copula.

* 3.4.2. Neural Composition Functions:

  * Train a neural network f_{\text{comp}} such that \theta_{P(V_C)} = f_{\text{comp}}(\{\theta_{P(V_i)}\}; C; W_{\text{comp}}).

  * Architectures: Multi-layer perceptrons, attention mechanisms (learning to weight the importance of different P(V_i) based on C), Graph Neural Networks (if \{V_i\} have a relational structure). For instance, ELM composing sentence meaning distribution from word meaning distributions.

* 3.4.3. Handling Dependencies: Explicitly modeling correlations between \{V_i\} (e.g., using multivariate distributions for the set \{V_i\}) or making justifiable conditional independence assumptions. Learned latent variable models can capture shared underlying factors.

3.5. Value Decomposition Engine (\{P(V_i)'\} \approx \mathcal{F}_{\text{decomp}}(P(V_C), C)) Analyzing a composite P(V_C) to understand its constituents or attribute its characteristics.

* 3.5.1. Probabilistic Factorization Methods:

  * Probabilistic PCA/Factor Analysis (FA)/Independent Component Analysis (ICA): If V_C is a high-dimensional vector distribution, these methods find underlying latent probabilistic factors V_i that generate V_C. E.g., V_C = W Z + \epsilon, where Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I) are latent factors, W is a loading matrix.

  * Mixture Models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models): Model P(V_C) as a weighted sum of simpler component distributions P(V_C) = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k P(V_C|k; \theta_k). Decomposition infers components P(V_C|k) and weights w_k.

* 3.5.2. Neural Decomposition Functions:

  * Autoencoder-like structures where an encoder f_{\text{decomp}} maps \theta_{P(V_C)} to \{\theta_{P(V_i)'}\}.

  * Invertible neural networks (Normalizing Flows) used for composition can sometimes be run in reverse for decomposition if the components are defined as the base distribution variables.

* 3.5.3. Attribution for Explainability:

  * Adapting XAI techniques:
    * Gradient-based: Compute gradients of parameters of P(V_C) (e.g., \mu_{V_C}, \Sigma_{V_C}) with respect to parameters of constituent P(V_i) (e.g., \frac{\partial \mu_{V_C}}{\partial \mu_{V_i}}).

    * Perturbation-based (e.g., SHAP, LIME adapted for distributions): Analyze how perturbations in the statistics of P(V_i) affect P(V_C). This requires defining appropriate perturbation strategies for distributions.

* This allows identifying which P(V_i) most significantly influenced the mean, variance, or other properties of P(V_C), directly supporting EMetaM's function.

4. Integration of VALCORE within HCDM
VALCORE is envisioned not as a monolithic module but as a set of principles and computational capabilities instantiated across HCDM modules. (HCDM is detailed in Shows, [Date of HCDM Publication, assumed]).

4.1. General Integration Principles via HCDM Mechanisms

* Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB): Modules post VALCORE-compliant probabilistic value representations (e.g., distribution parameter tensors, sample sets, or objects encapsulating these) to the NCB. Subscribing modules are equipped to process these probabilistic inputs. The NCB may itself employ VALCORE mechanisms for aggregating or summarizing probabilistic information streams.

* Dynamic Attention Routing (DAR): DAR's RL agent's state includes uncertainty metrics derived from VALCORE representations (e.g., entropy of P(\text{goal utility}) in EFM, variance of P(Q(s,a)) in AGM). DAR's policy can be trained to prioritize information routing that reduces critical uncertainties or maximizes expected information gain, potentially using an objective function like J = E[R] - \lambda H[P(V)].

* Neural Entanglement State Transfer (NEST): While VALCORE does not explicitly mandate quantum-inspired mechanisms, HCDM's NEST could be leveraged to propagate complex dependency structures or correlated uncertainties between probabilistic values across different modules. For instance, the density matrix \rho in NEST could evolve to represent joint probabilities P(V_A, V_B) for values V_A, V_B from distant modules, potentially offering a more holistic belief state than pairwise NCB communication alone.

4.2. Module-Specific VALCORE Instantiations

Each HCDM module would be enhanced as follows:

* EMM (Enhanced Memory Model):
  * Values: P(\text{Relevance}|Q,C) \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta); P(\text{Confidence in retrieval}); P(\text{Memory Content } M_i) itself (e.g., VAE latent for image).

  * Operations: Bayesian updates to \alpha,\beta based on feedback. Neural composition of relevance from multiple query features. Decomposition attributes low relevance to specific query elements.

* DSSM (Dynamic State Space Model):

  * Values: P(\text{State}_t | \text{History}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \Sigma_t) or particle set \{s_t^{(k)}\}.

  * Operations: Kalman/Particle filtering for state updates. Composition of complex states from object-centric probabilistic states. Decomposition to analyze prediction errors (e.g., which state dimension caused divergence from observation).

* ELM (Enhanced Language Model):

  * Values: P(\text{Embedding}_{\text{word/sentence}}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_e, \Sigma_e) or via VAE. P(\text{Parse Tree}); P(\text{Semantic Role}).

  * Operations: Neural composition (e.g., Transformer on distribution parameters) for sentence meaning. Decomposition for disambiguation (e.g., mixture model over meanings, attribution to contextual cues). Updates based on dialogue context.

* EMoM (Emotional Motivational Module):

  * Values: P(\text{Emotional State}_{\text{VAD}}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{VAD}, \Sigma_{VAD}); P(\text{Utility of Goal } G_i) \sim \text{Gamma}(k, \theta).

  * Operations: Composition of P(\text{Emotional State}) from probabilistic appraisals (outputs of EFM/SPM value systems). Decomposition of complex mood into primary emotional drivers. Updates based on internal/external events.
  
* EFM (Executive Function Module):

  * Values: P(\text{Goal Priority}), P(\text{Task Utility}), P(\text{Resource Availability}), P(\text{Plan Success}).

  * Operations: Probabilistic planning by composing P(\text{Utility}) and P(\text{Success}) of sub-goals/actions. Decomposition to explain plan choices or failures (e.g., identifying sub-goal with highest variance contributing to risky plan). Dynamic updates based on progress and new information.

* AGM (Action Generation Module):

  * Values: P(\text{Policy } \pi(a|s)); P(Q(s,a)) (distributional RL, e.g., categorical or quantile representation).

  * Operations: Updates to P(Q(s,a)) via distributional Bellman equations. Composition for hierarchical actions. Decomposition for attributing action values to state features or explaining explorative choices (high variance in P(Q)).

* SCM (Social Cognition Module):

  * Values: P(\text{Belief}_{\text{other}}), P(\text{Intent}_{\text{other}}), P(\text{Trustworthiness}_{\text{other}}).

  * Operations: Bayesian updates of Theory of Mind variables based on observed actions. Composition to infer complex social scenarios. Decomposition to diagnose misunderstandings in social interactions.

* EMetaM (Enhanced Metacognition Module):

  * Values: P(\text{Accuracy of } P(V)_{\text{moduleX}}), P(\text{Confidence in System State}).
  * Operations: EMetaM is a primary consumer and director of VALCORE. It monitors uncertainty metrics (entropy, variance, KL divergence) of P(V) across HCDM. It uses VALCORE decomposition outputs from other modules to build causal models of system performance and identify sources of high system uncertainty or belief conflicts, guiding resource allocation or learning strategies.
4.3. Neuromodulatory System (NS) Interaction
NS signals (simulating DA, 5HT, ACh, NE) modulate VALCORE operations globally:
* NS_{DA} (Dopamine-like): Can scale reward prediction errors in updating \mu of P(Q) in AGM, or increase learning rates for mean parameters of positive utility values in EFM. May also transiently increase variance terms to promote exploration if prediction errors are high.
   \Delta \mu \propto NS_{DA} \cdot \text{TD_error}.
* NS_{5HT} (Serotonin-like): Can increase precision (reduce variance \sigma^2) of critical beliefs (e.g., in DSSM or EMM) or stabilize emotional states (EMoM) by damping update magnitudes or increasing reliance on priors.
   \sigma^2_{t+1} = (1 - \eta_{5HT} \cdot NS_{5HT}) \sigma^2_t + \eta_{5HT} \cdot NS_{5HT} \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{target}}.
* NS_{ACh} (Acetylcholine-like): Can enhance plasticity (learning rates for evidence components) in modules like EMM and ELM, or sharpen attentional focus in composition/decomposition engines by up-weighting specific P(V_i).
* NS_{NE} (Norepinephrine-like): Can modulate overall system arousal, potentially by globally decreasing variance (sharpening distributions for exploitation) or increasing the gain on mean components of salient values in response to urgent stimuli.

5. Implementation Strategies and Algorithmic Considerations
Implementing VALCORE within HCDM requires careful choices of data structures, network architectures, and learning paradigms.
5.1. Data Structures for Probabilistic Values

* Leverage libraries like TensorFlow Probability (TFP) or PyTorch Distributions (torch.distributions). These provide objects for various distributions (e.g., tfd.Normal, torch.distributions.Normal) that encapsulate parameters and offer methods for .sample(), .log_prob(), .mean(), .variance(), .entropy().
* Custom classes inheriting from these or wrapping them to include metadata relevant to HCDM (e.g., source module, timestamp, uncertainty type).
5.2. Neural Network Architectures for VALCORE Functions
* Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs): For implementing f_{\text{update}}, f_{\text{comp}}, f_{\text{decomp}} where uncertainty in the function itself is critical. Achieved via variational inference for weights (e.g., layers like TFP's DenseVariational).
* VAEs/Normalizing Flows: As described in 3.2.3. Encoders map inputs to distribution parameters; decoders map latent samples to value distribution parameters or samples.
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): If values V_i are nodes in a graph (e.g., EMM knowledge graph, SCM social network), GNN message passing can implement VALCORE composition, propagating and transforming distributional information.
* Transformers on Distribution Sequences: For temporal dynamics of probabilistic values (e.g., in DSSM or ELM), Transformers can be adapted where input/output tokens represent distribution parameters. Attention weights would reflect inter-distributional dependencies.
5.3. Learning Paradigms
* Variational Inference (VI): Primary method for training models with latent probabilistic representations (VAEs, BNNs, probabilistic LSTMs). Maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on data likelihood.
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|X)}[\log p(X|z)] - KL(q(z|X) || p(z)).
* Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Train AGM using algorithms that learn value distributions (e.g., C51, QR-DQN, IQN).
* Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): For VALCORE's composition/decomposition engines:
  * Composition: Predict parameters of P(V_C) given parameters of \{P(V_i)\}. Loss on distributional similarity (e.g., KL divergence, Wasserstein distance).
  * Decomposition: Autoencoder-style, reconstruct P(V_C) from its decomposed \{P(V_i)'\}.
* Meta-Learning: Train EFM or EMetaM to adapt VALCORE parameters (e.g., choice of distribution family, learning rates for updates) based on task performance or environmental statistics.
5.4. Computational and Algorithmic Challenges
* Efficiency: Operations on distributions (sampling, log_prob calculations, convolutions) are more expensive than scalar/vector operations. Requires optimized implementations, potential use of low-rank approximations for covariances, or sparsification.
* Gradient Estimation: Backpropagation through stochastic sampling requires techniques like the reparameterization trick (for continuous variables) or score function estimators (e.g., REINFORCE, Gumbel-Softmax for discrete variables).
* Numerical Stability: Ensuring positive definite covariance matrices, avoiding underflow/overflow in log-probabilities, especially with complex distributions or long recurrent updates.
* Scalability: Managing and learning potentially millions of distributional parameters across a large-scale architecture like HCDM. Modularity and hierarchical abstraction in VALCORE will be key.

6. Evaluation Methodology
Evaluating VALCORE's efficacy requires assessing its probabilistic fidelity, the quality of its transformations, and its impact on HCDM's task performance and cognitive characteristics.
6.1. Intrinsic Probabilistic Metrics

* Calibration: Is P(V) well-calibrated? (e.g., Expected Calibration Error - ECE). If VALCORE predicts an event has probability 0.8, does it occur 80% of the time?
* Log-Likelihood (NLL): Average negative log-likelihood of held-out data under the predicted distributions.
* Brier Score / Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS): Proper scoring rules for probabilistic predictions.
* Distributional Distances: (If ground truth distributions are known or can be approximated) KL Divergence, Wasserstein Distance between predicted P(V) and true P^*(V).
6.2. Composition/Decomposition Quality Metrics
* Reconstruction Fidelity: For V_C \rightarrow \{V_i\}' \rightarrow V_C', measure D(P(V_C) || P(V_C')) where D is a distributional distance.
* Component Identifiability: In synthetic tasks with known ground-truth components \{V_i^*\}, how well does decomposition recover them? (e.g., using metrics like Adjusted Rand Index for clustering components).
* Attribution Faithfulness & Plausibility: For explanations from decomposition, use established XAI metrics (e.g., faithfulness to the model, human plausibility studies).
6.3. Task-Based Performance within HCDM
* Standard Benchmarks Adapted for Uncertainty: Evaluate VALCORE-enhanced HCDM on tasks requiring reasoning under uncertainty, partial observability, or risk sensitivity (e.g., contextual bandits, probabilistic planning problems, dialogue systems managing belief states).
* CompACT (Integrated Comprehensive Artificial Cognition Test - HCDM IV): Measure overall cognitive performance uplift, particularly on sub-tasks sensitive to robust uncertainty handling or explainability demands.
* Sample Efficiency & Robustness: Does VALCORE improve HCDM's learning speed in uncertain environments or its robustness to noisy/adversarial inputs?
6.4. Ablation Studies
* Systematically disable or simplify VALCORE mechanisms in specific HCDM modules (e.g., revert to deterministic values, simpler update rules) and measure performance degradation on targeted tasks to quantify VALCORE's contribution.
6.5. Explainability Evaluation
* Qualitative: Human studies assessing the clarity, coherence, and utility of explanations generated by EMetaM leveraging VALCORE's decomposition.
* Quantitative: Metrics like explanation complexity (e.g., number of identified components), fidelity of explanation to model behavior on counterfactual inputs.

7. Discussion
7.1. Expected Contributions and Advantages
The VALCORE framework, when integrated into cognitive architectures like HCDM, is anticipated to yield several significant advantages:

* Enhanced Robustness: Explicit modeling of uncertainty allows for more graceful degradation in the face of noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete information.
* Improved Adaptability: Dynamic value updating mechanisms enable the system to adjust its internal valuations and strategies in response to changing contexts, evidence, and internal states.
* Principled Explainability (XAI): The value decomposition engine provides inherent interpretability by attributing complex values and decisions to their underlying probabilistic sources, offering a degree of transparency often lacking in contemporary AI.
* Nuanced Reasoning and Decision-Making: VALCORE facilitates more sophisticated reasoning that considers likelihoods, confidence levels, and potential risks (variance), moving beyond deterministic logic towards risk-sensitive decision-making as seen in humans.
* Better Credit Assignment: Decomposition aids in assigning credit or blame to constituent values or beliefs, which is crucial for effective learning and refinement of internal models.
7.2. Limitations and Challenges
Despite its promise, VALCORE faces substantial challenges:
* Computational Cost and Scalability: Manipulating and performing inference with probability distributions (especially non-parametric or high-dimensional ones) is computationally intensive. Scaling VALCORE across all modules of a comprehensive architecture like HCDM is a formidable engineering task.
* Learning Complexity: Training models to learn and operate on complex probabilistic representations and their transformations is non-trivial. This includes challenges in optimization, avoiding poor local optima, and ensuring convergence.
* Theoretical Soundness of Learned Compositions: While principled methods exist for composing specific distributions, ensuring the universal applicability and mathematical soundness of learned composition/decomposition functions for arbitrary distributions and dependencies is an open research area.
* Choice of Priors and Distributional Families: The selection of appropriate prior distributions and parametric families for values can significantly impact performance and may require substantial domain knowledge or meta-learning. Incorrect choices can lead to miscalibrated uncertainty or poor model fit.
* Parameter Explosion and Identifiability: Representing many values as distributions increases the number of parameters to learn and manage. Ensuring identifiability of components in decomposition can also be difficult.
7.3. Broader Impact
VALCORE represents a step towards AI systems that possess a deeper, more flexible "understanding" of value, akin to human cognitive processes. This could have far-reaching implications for applications requiring high levels of autonomy, trustworthiness, and human-AI collaboration, such as in complex decision support, robotics, and personalized education or healthcare.

8. Future Directions
The VALCORE framework opens several avenues for future research:

* Hierarchical and Recursive VALCORE Structures: Applying VALCORE principles recursively, allowing for probabilistic meta-values (e.g., P(\text{Confidence in } P(V))) and composition/decomposition across multiple levels of abstraction, aligning with hierarchical processing in HCDM.
* Causal VALCORE: Integrating causal discovery and inference methods (e.g., Pearl, 2009) with the decomposition engine to learn causal relationships between values, rather than just correlational factors or attributions.
* Hardware Acceleration for Probabilistic Computation: Development of specialized hardware (e.g., analog or neuromorphic probabilistic processing units) to efficiently implement VALCORE's operations, mitigating computational bottlenecks.
* VALCORE in Embodied and Interactive Agents: Exploring how sensorimotor interaction within an embodied agent (as per HCDM's future directions) shapes the dynamic probabilistic values, and how VALCORE contributes to active perception and learning.
* Hybrid Probabilistic Paradigms: Investigating the integration of alternative uncertainty representation formalisms (e.g., fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory) alongside standard probability theory within VALCORE to handle different types of uncertainty (aleatoric vs. epistemic, vagueness).
* Meta-Learning VALCORE Structures and Operations: Developing methods for the AI system itself to learn the optimal way to represent, compose, or decompose values for a given task or domain, rather than relying solely on predefined structures (e.g., learning the composition function \mathcal{F}_{\text{comp}} itself).
* Formal Verification of Probabilistic Reasoning: Exploring methods for formally verifying the correctness and safety properties of systems employing VALCORE, especially in safety-critical applications.

9. Conclusion
VALCORE offers a novel and comprehensive perspective on managing value within sophisticated AI systems, aiming to transcend the limitations of traditional static and deterministic representations. By systematically incorporating probabilistic modeling, dynamic updates, and explicit mechanisms for value composition and decomposition, the framework holds significant potential for enhancing the adaptability, robustness, reasoning capabilities, and intrinsic explainability of cognitive architectures such as HCDM. While substantial theoretical, computational, and implementation challenges remain, VALCORE provides a rich conceptual foundation for exploring how AI can reason more effectively under the pervasive uncertainty inherent in complex, dynamic worlds. Its continued development and empirical validation represent a key research direction for advancing artificial intelligence towards greater generality and a more nuanced, human-like engagement with value.

Appendices

Appendix A: Detailed Mathematical Formulations
This appendix provides illustrative mathematical details for some of the core probabilistic operations within the VALCORE framework.
A.1. Bayesian Update: Beta-Bernoulli Model for Probabilistic Relevance
Consider a scenario within HCDM's Enhanced Memory Model (EMM) where the relevance R of a memory item is a binary variable (R=1 for relevant, R=0 for not relevant). The probability of relevance, \theta_R = P(R=1), is unknown. VALCORE represents this uncertainty using a Beta distribution for \theta_R:
P(\theta_R | \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \text{Beta}(\theta_R; \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha_0 + \beta_0)}{\Gamma(\alpha_0)\Gamma(\beta_0)} \theta_R^{\alpha_0-1} (1-\theta_R)^{\beta_0-1}
where \alpha_0, \beta_0 are the prior hyperparameters (e.g., from past experience or a non-informative prior like \alpha_0=1, \beta_0=1).
Suppose new evidence \mathcal{E} is observed in the form of N independent assessments of relevance for this item, resulting in k instances where the item was deemed relevant and N-k instances where it was not. The likelihood of this evidence given \theta_R is a Binomial distribution:
P(\mathcal{E} | \theta_R) = \text{Binomial}(k; N, \theta_R) = \binom{N}{k} \theta_R^k (1-\theta_R)^{N-k}
Due to the conjugacy of the Beta prior and Binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution P(\theta_R | \mathcal{E}, \alpha_0, \beta_0) is also a Beta distribution:
P(\theta_R | \mathcal{E}, \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \text{Beta}(\theta_R; \alpha_N, \beta_N)
where the updated hyperparameters are:
\alpha_N = \alpha_0 + k
\beta_N = \beta_0 + (N-k)
The EMM would store and propagate (\alpha_N, \beta_N) as the parameters of the probabilistic relevance score. The expected relevance is E[\theta_R | \mathcal{E}] = \frac{\alpha_N}{\alpha_N + \beta_N}, and the confidence can be related to the variance \text{Var}(\theta_R | \mathcal{E}) = \frac{\alpha_N \beta_N}{(\alpha_N + \beta_N)^2 (\alpha_N + \beta_N + 1)}. This update is computationally efficient and analytically tractable.
A.2. Composition of Gaussian Distributions: Linear Combination
Consider two independent probabilistic values V_1 and V_2 represented by Gaussian distributions:
V_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)
V_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)
Suppose a composite value V_C is formed by a linear combination V_C = aV_1 + bV_2 + c, where a, b, c are scalar constants (potentially determined by context or a learned function).
The mean of V_C is:
E[V_C] = E[aV_1 + bV_2 + c] = aE[V_1] + bE[V_2] + c = a\mu_1 + b\mu_2 + c
The variance of V_C, given independence of V_1 and V_2, is:
\text{Var}(V_C) = \text{Var}(aV_1 + bV_2 + c) = a^2\text{Var}(V_1) + b^2\text{Var}(V_2) = a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2
Thus, the composite value V_C is also Gaussian:
V_C \sim \mathcal{N}(a\mu_1 + b\mu_2 + c, a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2)
If V_1 and V_2 are d-dimensional vectors V_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}_1, \Sigma_1) and V_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}_2, \Sigma_2), and A, B are matrices, V_C = AV_1 + BV_2 + \vec{c}.
Then E[V_C] = A\vec{\mu}_1 + B\vec{\mu}_2 + \vec{c}.
If V_1, V_2 are independent, \text{Var}(V_C) = \Sigma_C = A\Sigma_1 A^T + B\Sigma_2 B^T.
If V_1, V_2 are correlated with covariance \text{Cov}(V_1, V_2) = \Sigma_{12} (and \text{Cov}(V_2, V_1) = \Sigma_{21} = \Sigma_{12}^T), then:
\Sigma_C = A\Sigma_1 A^T + B\Sigma_2 B^T + A\Sigma_{12}B^T + B\Sigma_{21}A^T
This illustrates how VALCORE's composition engine would operate on parameters of Gaussian distributions. More complex compositions (non-linear, or with non-Gaussian distributions) might require approximation methods like Monte Carlo sampling, linearization (e.g., for Extended Kalman Filters), or variational approximations.
A.3. Variational Inference Objective (ELBO) for a VAE Representing a Value
Suppose a value V (e.g., a semantic embedding in ELM) is modeled by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VAE assumes a generative process P(V, z) = P(V|z; \theta)P(z), where z is a latent variable with prior P(z) (e.g., \mathcal{N}(0,I)), and P(V|z; \theta) is the likelihood function (decoder network with parameters \theta). The goal is to maximize the marginal likelihood P(V) = \int P(V|z; \theta)P(z) dz.
Since computing P(V|X) (where X is the input conditioning V, e.g. a word) involves an intractable posterior P(z|V,X), VI introduces an approximate posterior q(z|V,X; \phi) (encoder network with parameters \phi).
The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; V,X), is maximized:
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; V,X) = E_{q(z|V,X; \phi)}[\log P(V|z; \theta)] - KL(q(z|V,X; \phi) || P(z))
The first term is the reconstruction likelihood: it encourages the decoder to accurately reconstruct V from latent samples z drawn from the approximate posterior. The second term is a regularization term that encourages the approximate posterior to be close to the prior P(z).
The parameters of q(z|V,X; \phi) (e.g., mean and variance if q is Gaussian) are themselves probabilistic representations within VALCORE, representing uncertainty over the latent encoding of V. The output P(V|z; \theta) (e.g., a Gaussian distribution over embeddings, \mathcal{N}(\mu_V(z), \Sigma_V(z))) is another VALCORE probabilistic value.
Appendix B: Pseudocode for Core VALCORE Operations
This appendix provides conceptual pseudocode for some VALCORE mechanisms. This is illustrative and abstracts away many implementation details.
B.1. Probabilistic Value Object Structure (Python-like)
class ProbabilisticValue:
    def __init__(self, type_name, parameters):
        self.type_name = type_name # e.g., "Gaussian", "Beta", "Samples"
        self.parameters = parameters # dict of tensors, e.g., {'mean': mu, 'cov_chol': L} for Gaussian
        # Internal representation using a library like torch.distributions
        self._dist = self._create_distribution(type_name, parameters)

    def _create_distribution(self, type_name, params):
        # Simplified: maps type_name and params to a library distribution object
        if type_name == "Gaussian":
            # Assuming params include 'mean' and 'covariance_matrix' or 'scale_tril'
            return torch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(loc=params['mean'], 
                                                          covariance_matrix=params.get('cov_matrix'),
                                                          scale_tril=params.get('scale_tril'))
        elif type_name == "Beta":
            return torch.distributions.Beta(params['alpha'], params['beta'])
        # ... other distribution types
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported distribution type: {type_name}")

    def sample(self, sample_shape=torch.Size()):
        return self._dist.sample(sample_shape)

    def log_prob(self, value_tensor):
        return self._dist.log_prob(value_tensor)

    def mean(self):
        return self._dist.mean

    def variance(self):
        return self._dist.variance

    def entropy(self):
        return self._dist.entropy

    def get_parameters(self):
        return self.parameters # For propagation or learning

    def update_parameters(self, new_parameters):
        # E.g., after a Bayesian update or RNN step
        self.parameters = new_parameters
        self._dist = self._create_distribution(self.type_name, new_parameters)

B.2. Neural Composition Function (Illustrative)
Let's assume composing two 1D Gaussian values P(V_1) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2) and P(V_2) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2) into P(V_C) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_C, \sigma_C^2) using a neural network, potentially with context C_{ctx}.
import torch.nn as nn

class NeuralGaussianComposer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim_dist_params, context_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim_dist_params):
        super().__init__()
        # input_dim_dist_params = 4 (mu1, log_sigma1_sq, mu2, log_sigma2_sq)
        # output_dim_dist_params = 2 (mu_c, log_sigma_c_sq)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim_dist_params + context_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc_mu = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim_dist_params // 2) # Output mu_c
        self.fc_log_var = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim_dist_params // 2) # Output log(sigma_c^2)

    def forward(self, params_v1, params_v2, context_tensor):
        # params_v1 = [mu1, log_sigma1_sq_tensor]
        # params_v2 = [mu2, log_sigma2_sq_tensor]
        
        input_vec = torch.cat([params_v1['mean'], torch.log(params_v1['variance']), 
                               params_v2['mean'], torch.log(params_v2['variance']), 
                               context_tensor], dim=-1)
        
        hidden = self.relu(self.fc1(input_vec))
        
        mu_c = self.fc_mu(hidden)
        log_sigma_c_sq = self.fc_log_var(hidden) # Ensure variance is positive
        sigma_c_sq = torch.exp(log_sigma_c_sq)

        # Return parameters for the composed Gaussian distribution
        return {'mean': mu_c, 'variance': sigma_c_sq}

# Usage:
# composer_nn = NeuralGaussianComposer(...)
# pv1 = ProbabilisticValue("Gaussian", {'mean': m1, 'variance': v1})
# pv2 = ProbabilisticValue("Gaussian", {'mean': m2, 'variance': v2})
# context = current_context_tensor
# composed_params = composer_nn(pv1.get_parameters(), pv2.get_parameters(), context)
# pv_composed = ProbabilisticValue("Gaussian", composed_params)

Note: Using \log(\sigma^2) as network output and then exponentiating is a common trick to ensure variance is positive. For covariance matrices, Cholesky decomposition parameters are often learned.
B.3. Attribution via Gradients (Simplified Example for Decomposition Insights)
Suppose P(V_C) is composed from \{P(V_i)\} and we want to know how \mu_{V_i} (mean of an input value) influences \mu_{V_C} (mean of the composed value). This provides a basic form of decomposition/explanation.
def get_influence_on_mean(composed_value_object, input_value_object_params, composition_function):
    # Ensure input_value_object_params['mean'] requires gradients
    input_mean_tensor = input_value_object_params['mean'].detach().requires_grad_(True)

    # Temporarily update parameters of input_value_object for the forward pass
    # (assuming other parameters of input_value_object are fixed or also tensors)
    temp_input_params = {**input_value_object_params, 'mean': input_mean_tensor}

    # Perform composition (this could be a complex function involving neural nets or other ops)
    # For simplicity, assume composition_function takes a list of parameter dicts
    # and returns a parameter dict for the composed value.
    # We need to ensure the full computation graph to composed_value_object.mean() is built.
    
    # Example: if composition_function is the NeuralGaussianComposer from B.2
    # (assuming pv_other_inputs_params are parameters of other inputs to composition)
    # composed_params_dict = composition_function(temp_input_params, pv_other_inputs_params, context)
    # mu_c = composed_params_dict['mean']

    # More generally, if composed_value_object is already the result of such a function:
    # We'd need to re-run the composition with the specific input requiring grad.
    # This is a simplified placeholder for the actual computation:
    mu_c = composition_function(temp_input_params, ...).mean() # Access the mean of the resulting ProbabilisticValue

    # Compute gradients of the composed mean w.r.t. the input mean
    # If mu_c is scalar, otherwise sum or take a component.
    mu_c_scalar = mu_c.sum() # Example for multi-dimensional mean
    mu_c_scalar.backward()
    
    influence_gradient = input_mean_tensor.grad
    
    return influence_gradient

# Usage:
# Assume pv_composed resulted from composing pv1 and pv2 using composer_nn
# grad_mu_c_wrt_mu1 = get_influence_on_mean(pv_composed, pv1.get_parameters(),
#                                           lambda p1, p2, ctx: NeuralGaussianComposer(...)(p1,p2,ctx))
# This shows how a change in mu1 would affect mu_c.

Note: This is highly simplified. Proper implementation would involve careful handling of computation graphs and potentially using library functions for attribution like Captum for PyTorch models. For complex models, evaluating the gradient \frac{\partial \text{statistic}(P(V_C))}{\partial \text{statistic}(P(V_i))} might be non-trivial.
Appendix C: Further Notes on HCDM Integration Specifics
This appendix elaborates on the practical integration of VALCORE within HCDM.
C.1. NCB Data Transmission for Probabilistic Values
Modules posting to HCDM's Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) would transmit VALCORE ProbabilisticValue information. A standardized format would be crucial. Example JSON-like structure for a message on the NCB:
{
  "message_id": "uuid-1234-abcd-5678",
  "source_module": "EMM", // HCDM module originating the value
  "timestamp": "2025-05-12T18:30:05.123Z",
  "value_name": "memory_item_relevance", // Semantic name of the value
  "valcore_representation": {
    "type_name": "Beta", // From ProbabilisticValue.type_name
    "parameters": {       // From ProbabilisticValue.parameters
      "alpha": 15.3,      // Scalar or tensor data
      "beta": 4.2
    },
    "metadata": { // Optional VALCORE-specific metadata
      "confidence_metric": 0.92, // e.g., 1 - normalized variance
      "update_rule_used": "BayesianUpdate_BetaBernoulli",
      "evidence_sources": ["feedback_module_X", "efm_goal_context"]
    }
  },
  "target_modules": ["EFM", "AGM"] // Optional routing hint
}

Modules reading from the NCB would parse this structure, instantiate a local ProbabilisticValue object, and then use its methods (e.g., .sample(), .mean()) for their internal processing. Tensors for parameters would be transmitted directly in efficient binary formats if the NCB supports it, rather than JSON numbers for large data.
C.2. DAR State Representation and Action Example with VALCORE Metrics
HCDM's Dynamic Attention Routing (DAR) agent, likely an RL agent, would incorporate VALCORE-derived uncertainty metrics into its state representation.

* DAR State Features (Illustrative Additions):
  * avg_entropy_efm_goal_utilities: Average entropy of P(\text{Utility}) for active goals in EFM. High entropy might signal need for information gathering.
  * max_variance_agm_q_values: Maximum variance among P(Q(s,a)) for currently considered actions in AGM. High variance suggests high exploratory potential.
  * kl_divergence_dssm_state_prediction_observation: KL divergence between predicted P(S_{t+1}|S_t, A_t) and P(S_{t+1}|\text{Observation}_{t+1}) in DSSM. High KL could indicate surprising event.
  * num_conflicting_values_ncb: Number of values on NCB related to the same conceptual entity but with significantly different probabilistic representations (e.g., high KL divergence between them), detected by EMetaM.
* DAR Action Example:
   If avg_entropy_efm_goal_utilities is high and max_variance_agm_q_values for a specific goal-related action is also high:
   DAR_Action = Route(source=SPM_latest_observation, target=AGM_value_update_for_exploratory_action, priority=HIGH, bandwidth_allocation=0.3)
   DAR_Action_Concurrent = Route(source=EMM_query_relevant_to_high_entropy_goal, target=EFM_goal_utility_refinement_engine, priority=HIGH)
   Another action could be to trigger a specific VALCORE decomposition:
   DAR_Action = Trigger(module=EMoM, operation=VALCORE_Decomposition, target_value="current_emotional_state", reason="High_Variance_Unexplained")
C.3. EMetaM Consuming VALCORE Decomposition Output for System Monitoring
HCDM's Enhanced Metacognition Module (EMetaM) is a key consumer of VALCORE's analytical outputs. Suppose EFM makes a decision to abandon Goal A and pursue Goal B. EFM's internal VALCORE decomposition engine might produce an explanation:
* Decomposition Output from EFM (sent to EMetaM via NCB):
   {
  "source_module": "EFM",
  "value_decomposed": "Decision_Switch_Goal_A_to_B",
  "composed_value_metric": "P(Utility(Plan_B)) / P(Utility(Plan_A)) > Threshold_Switch",
  "contributing_factors": [
    {
      "factor_name": "P(Utility(SubGoal_A1_of_Plan_A))",
      "role": "NegativeInfluence_On_Plan_A_Utility",
      "probabilistic_value": {"type_name": "Gaussian", "parameters": {"mean": 2.5, "variance": 1.0}},
      "attribution_score": -0.85 // Normalized impact on decision
    },
    {
      "factor_name": "P(SuccessRate(SubGoal_B1_of_Plan_B))",
      "role": "PositiveInfluence_On_Plan_B_Utility",
      "probabilistic_value": {"type_name": "Beta", "parameters": {"alpha": 30.0, "beta": 5.0}},
      "attribution_score": 0.92
    },
    {
      "factor_name": "Context_Resource_Constraint_R1",
      "role": "Increased_Variance_In_SuccessRate_SubGoal_A1",
      "probabilistic_value": {"type_name": "Categorical", "parameters": {"probs": [0.1, 0.9]}}, // Low/High constraint
      "attribution_score_variance_impact": 0.75
    }
  ],
  "explanation_summary": "Switched to Goal B primarily due to a sharp decrease in projected utility of SubGoal A1 (mean=2.5), coupled with high confidence in success for SubGoal B1 (mean_success=0.85). Resource constraint R1 significantly increased uncertainty for Plan A."
}

EMetaM would log this, potentially flag the sensitivity to Resource R1 for future planning, or use the summary for generating user-facing explanations or internal system self-correction strategies (e.g., initiating learning to better predict utility under R1 constraint).
C.4. NS Modulating a VALCORE Update Rule in AGM
Consider the update of P(Q(s,a)) in HCDM's Action Generation Module (AGM), specifically the mean \mu_{Q(s,a)} of this distribution, using a distributional Temporal Difference (TD) error, \delta_t^{dist}.
A Neuromodulatory System (NS) signal, NS_{DA} (simulating dopamine's role in reward learning), could modulate the learning rate \eta_Q for this update:
\mu_{Q(s,a), t+1} = \mu_{Q(s,a), t} + (\eta_Q \cdot (1 + \lambda_{DA} \cdot \text{clip}(NS_{DA,t}, 0, \text{max_mod}))) \cdot E[\delta_t^{dist}]
Where:

* \eta_Q is the base learning rate for Q-value means.
* NS_{DA,t} is the current dopamine-like signal from NS (e.g., scaled between -1 and 1, or simply positive).
* \lambda_{DA} is a sensitivity parameter controlling how much NS_{DA} affects the learning rate.
* \text{clip}(...) ensures the modulation stays within reasonable bounds.
* E[\delta_t^{dist}] is the expectation of the distributional TD error (or a relevant statistic).
If NS_{DA,t} is high (e.g., following a surprisingly positive outcome), the effective learning rate increases, leading to a more substantial update of \mu_{Q(s,a)}. Conversely, a low or negative NS_{DA,t} (e.g., after a negative surprise) could reduce the learning rate or even facilitate learning about punishments if the TD error is negative. Similarly, NS_{NE} (norepinephrine-like) might modulate the variance term \sigma^2_{Q(s,a)} update, e.g., increasing it during exploration or decreasing it to sharpen exploitation based on perceived environmental volatility or task demands.

Date: May 12, 2025
Abstract: Advanced artificial intelligence systems, particularly those striving for cognitive flexibility, must navigate pervasive uncertainty, operate within dynamic environments, and manage the complex interplay of multifaceted "values" (e.g., utility, salience, semantic certainty, emotional valence). Prevailing approaches often employ deterministic or static value representations, limiting adaptability, nuanced reasoning under uncertainty, and robust decision-making. This paper introduces VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a comprehensive theoretical framework for the probabilistic and dynamic management of values within AI systems. VALCORE specifies mechanisms for: (1) Representing diverse values as probability distributions or belief states, capturing inherent uncertainty and confidence. (2) Dynamically updating these probabilistic value representations based on new evidence and internal cognitive states using principled Bayesian methods or learned recurrent models. (3) Composing complex, higher-order probabilistic values from simpler constituents via learned functions or probabilistic calculus, enabling sophisticated synthesis under uncertainty. (4) Decomposing complex probabilistic values into their underlying components or attributing them to generative sources using techniques such as probabilistic factor analysis or learned attribution methods, facilitating analysis, explanation, and credit assignment. We detail VALCORE's core principles and potential integration strategies applicable to various architectural designs. By endowing AI with the capacity to handle values in this flexible, probabilistic manner, VALCORE promises significant improvements in adaptability, robustness under uncertainty, contextual reasoning, and inherent explainability, crucial steps towards more general and capable artificial intelligence.

1. Introduction
The pursuit of more adaptable and robust artificial intelligence necessitates systems that can manage uncertainty and nuanced evaluations effectively. A fundamental aspect of sophisticated reasoning is the handling of "value" in its myriad forms—utility, salience, semantic meaning, emotional significance, goal priority, and belief strength. Biological cognitive systems do not operate with absolute certainties; rather, they maintain degrees of belief, dynamically update valuations based on evolving contexts and internal states, compose complex judgments from uncertain evidence, and decompose intricate feelings or decisions to understand their origins (Gershman, 2015; Tenenbaum et al., 2011).
Current AI systems often fall short in this regard. Value representations are frequently deterministic scalars or static vectors, changing primarily through direct reward signals (Sutton & Barto, 2018). This limits their ability to: (a) represent and reason about uncertainty explicitly, (b) adapt value structures to novel contexts dynamically, (c) synthesize complex, multi-faceted values from simpler, uncertain components, and (d) provide transparent explanations for how values are derived and influence behavior. These limitations pose significant barriers to achieving more flexible, robust, and generalizable AI.
To address these lacunae, we propose VALCORE (Value Composition, Decomposition, and Reasoning Engine), a theoretical framework designed for the principled management of probabilistic and dynamic values within AI systems and cognitive architectures. VALCORE is not a standalone algorithm but a set of architectural principles and computational mechanisms that enable an AI system to:

* Represent diverse types of value as probabilistic entities (e.g., probability distributions, belief states), explicitly encoding uncertainty and confidence.
* Dynamically update these probabilistic representations over time based on new sensory evidence, internal processing, and contextual shifts, employing methods like Bayesian inference or learned recurrent models.
* Systematically compose complex probabilistic values from simpler constituents through learned functions or probabilistic calculus, enabling nuanced synthesis under uncertainty.
* Systematically decompose complex probabilistic values into their underlying components or attribute them to generative sources, facilitating analysis, credit assignment, and intrinsic explainability.
This paper makes the following contributions:
* Formalization of a theoretical framework (VALCORE) for probabilistic, dynamic value representation, update, composition, and decomposition adaptable to various AI architectures.
* Detailed specification of potential computational mechanisms, including parametric and non-parametric distributional representations, Bayesian and neural update rules, and formalisms for value composition and decomposition.
* A discussion of general architectural integration principles for incorporating VALCORE capabilities into cognitive systems.
* A discussion of implementation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and the potential advantages and challenges of the VALCORE framework.
The VALCORE framework aims to provide a crucial layer of cognitive processing that we argue is essential for developing AI systems capable of more sophisticated reasoning, adaptability, and explainability in complex, uncertain, and dynamic environments.

2. Related Work
VALCORE draws inspiration from and aims to synthesize concepts from several distinct but related fields:

* Cognitive Architectures: Frameworks like ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004), Soar (Laird, 2012), LIDA (Franklin et al., 2013), and Sigma (Rosenbloom et al., 2016) have long sought to model cognition by integrating multiple functions. While some architectures incorporate notions of utility or activation, VALCORE's explicit focus on representing potentially all forms of value probabilistically and providing general mechanisms for their dynamic composition/decomposition offers a more systematic approach to uncertainty management adaptable to various architectural philosophies.
* Probabilistic AI and Machine Learning:
  * Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL): BDL introduces uncertainty into deep neural networks (Blundell et al., 2015; Kendall & Gal, 2017). VALCORE leverages BDL techniques for implementing its probabilistic value representations and update mechanisms but situates them within a broader architectural context.
  * Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs): PPLs like Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017), Pyro (Bingham et al., 2019), and TensorFlow Probability (Dillon et al., 2017) provide tools for probabilistic modeling. VALCORE's mechanisms could be implemented using PPLs, but VALCORE itself is an architectural blueprint.
  * Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL): DRL explicitly models the distribution of returns (Bellemare et al., 2017; Dabney et al., 2018). VALCORE adopts this principle for action values within potential action selection modules and generalizes it to other types of values.
* Explainable AI (XAI): Many XAI methods are post-hoc (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Lundberg & Lee, 2017). VALCORE’s value decomposition engine aims to provide intrinsic explainability by design, attributing composed values to their constituent probabilistic sources.
* Neuroscience and Cognitive Science:
  * Bayesian Brain Hypothesis & Predictive Coding: Theories positing probabilistic representation and updates in the brain (Knill & Pouget, 2004; Friston, 2010) directly inspire VALCORE's approach.
  * Appraisal Theories of Emotion: These theories suggest emotions arise from evaluating situations (Scherer et al., 2001). VALCORE’s composition mechanism within a potential emotion/motivation module can be seen as a computational instantiation of such appraisal processes.
  * Decision Theory & Prospect Theory: Fields studying choice under uncertainty (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). VALCORE enables representation of subjective utilities as distributions and decision-making considering uncertainty.
VALCORE distinguishes itself by providing a unified architectural framework for these diverse probabilistic concepts, focusing specifically on the lifecycle of "value" within a cognitive system, independent of any single overarching architecture.

3. The VALCORE Framework
VALCORE is founded on the principle that values within an AI system are rarely known with certainty and often arise from, or contribute to, complex interactions.
3.1. Core Principles

* Value (V): A quantifiable representation of utility, belief strength, semantic certainty, salience, an emotional state component, goal priority, etc. Critically, V is not a point estimate but a probabilistic quantity.
* Probability (P(V)): Uncertainty is explicitly modeled using probability distributions or equivalent belief representations over the space of V.
* Dynamics (\\frac{dP(V)}{dt}): The probabilistic representation P(V) evolves over time based on new evidence \\mathcal{E}, internal cognitive operations, and contextual shifts C.
* Composition (P(V\_C) = \\mathcal{F}*{\\text{comp}}({P(V\_i)}*{i=1}^n, C)): Mechanisms for synthesizing a composite probabilistic value P(V\_C) from constituent probabilistic values {P(V\_i)}.
* Decomposition ({P(V\_i)'} \\approx \\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{decomp}}(P(V\_C), C)): Mechanisms for analyzing a composite value P(V\_C) to infer properties of its constituents or attribute V\_C to its sources.
3.2. Probabilistic Value Representations (P(V))
VALCORE accommodates various representations:
* 3.2.1. Parametric Distributions: Efficient for well-characterized uncertainties. Examples:
  * Gaussian (V \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)): For continuous values (e.g., state variables in a state representation module, semantic embeddings in a language processing module). \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, \\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}.
  * Beta (V \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)): For V \\in [0,1] (e.g., probabilities, relevance scores in a memory system, confidence in a metacognitive monitor). \\alpha, \\beta \> 0.
  * Dirichlet (V \\sim \\text{Dir}(\\vec{\\alpha})): For probability vectors over K categories, \\sum\_{k=1}^K V\_k = 1 (e.g., action selection probabilities in an action selection module, discrete emotional state probabilities in an emotion/motivation module). \\alpha\_k \> 0.
  * Von Mises-Fisher (V \\sim \\text{vMF}(\\mu, \\kappa)): For directional data on a hypersphere |V|=1 (e.g., attention vectors in an attentional network). \\mu is mean direction, \\kappa is concentration.
  * Others: Gamma (for positive continuous values), Student's t (for heavy-tailed continuous values).
* 3.2.2. Non-Parametric Representations: Flexible for complex uncertainties. Examples: Monte Carlo Samples {v\_s}*{s=1}^S, Kernel Density Estimators (P(V) = \\frac{1}{S}\\sum*{s=1}^S K\_h(V - v\_s)), Quantile Representations/Implicit Distributions.
* 3.2.3. Latent Variable Models (LVMs): Implicit definition via latent variables z \\sim P(z) and a generative function V = g(z, \\text{context}). Examples: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Normalizing Flows (V = f\_K \\circ \\dots \\circ f\_1(z)), Gaussian Processes (V(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))) (e.g., for modeling value functions Q(s,a) in an action selection module or utility landscapes in an executive function module).
3.3. Dynamic Value Update Mechanisms (P\_t(V) \\rightarrow P\_{t+1}(V))
Values evolve based on new evidence \\mathcal{E}\_t and context C\_t.
* 3.3.1. Bayesian Inference: Using Bayes' theorem P(V|\\mathcal{E}\_t, C\_t) \\propto P(\\mathcal{E}*t|V, C\_t) P(V|\\mathcal{E}*{t-1}, C\_t).
  * Methods: Conjugate Priors (if available), Approximate Inference (Markov Chain Monte Carlo - MCMC, Variational Inference - VI), Sequential Bayesian Filtering (Kalman Filters, Particle Filters - potentially useful in a state representation module).
* 3.3.2. Recurrent Neural Models: RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) outputting distribution parameters \\theta\_{P(V\_t)} = f\_{\\text{RNN}}(\\theta\_{P(V\_{t-1})}, x\_t, C\_t; W\_{\\text{RNN}}).
* 3.3.3. Contextual and Modulatory Influence:
  * Attentional Modulation: Gating/weighting evidence influence (potentially via an attentional network).
  * Neuromodulatory Influence: Signals (simulating dopamine, serotonin, etc., if modeled by the host architecture) could alter update parameters (e.g., learning rates \\eta, prior strengths, variance scaling). Example: Update rule might have \\eta\_t = \\text{NS\_signal\_t} \\cdot \\eta\_0.
  * Executive Control: A potential executive function module could initiate updates, set precision targets, or switch update models based on strategic goals.
3.4. Value Composition Engine (P(V\_C) = \\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{comp}}({P(V\_i)}, C))
Synthesizing a composite P(V\_C) from constituents {P(V\_i)}.
* 3.4.1. Formalisms for Composition: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), Probabilistic Logic/Arithmetic (e.g., combining P(A), P(B) to get P(A \\land B); V\_C = V\_A + V\_B leads to convolution P(V\_C) = P(V\_A) \* P(V\_B) if independent), Fuzzy Set Operations (using t-norms, t-conorms), Copula Functions (for modeling dependencies P(V\_1, \\dots, V\_n) = C(F\_1(V\_1), \\dots, F\_n(V\_n))).
* 3.4.2. Neural Composition Functions: Training a neural network f\_{\\text{comp}} such that \\theta\_{P(V\_C)} = f\_{\\text{comp}}({\\theta\_{P(V\_i)}}; C; W\_{\\text{comp}}). Examples: MLPs, Attention Mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (e.g., a language processing module composing sentence meaning distribution).
* 3.4.3. Handling Dependencies: Explicit modeling of correlations (e.g., multivariate distributions) or justifiable conditional independence assumptions.
3.5. Value Decomposition Engine ({P(V\_i)'} \\approx \\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{decomp}}(P(V\_C), C))
Analyzing P(V\_C) to understand its constituents.
* 3.5.1. Probabilistic Factorization Methods: Probabilistic PCA/Factor Analysis (FA)/Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (e.g., V\_C = W Z + \\epsilon, where Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I)), Mixture Models (e.g., GMMs, P(V\_C) = \\sum\_{k=1}^K w\_k P(V\_C|k; \\theta\_k)).
* 3.5.2. Neural Decomposition Functions: Autoencoder-like structures mapping \\theta\_{P(V\_C)} \\rightarrow {\\theta\_{P(V\_i)'}}, potentially using invertible networks.
* 3.5.3. Attribution for Explainability: Adapting XAI techniques (gradient-based: \\frac{\\partial \\mu\_{V\_C}}{\\partial \\mu\_{V\_i}}; perturbation-based: SHAP/LIME adapted for distributions) to identify which P(V\_i) significantly influenced P(V\_C). This supports the function of a potential metacognitive module.

4. Architectural Integration Principles
VALCORE is designed as a set of principles and capabilities that can be integrated into various cognitive architectures or AI systems, rather than being a rigid, monolithic structure. Integration strategies include:

* Enhancing Core Cognitive Modules: VALCORE capabilities can be embedded within typical functional modules found in cognitive architectures:
  * Memory Systems: Represent memory trace strength, familiarity, or retrieval confidence as distributions (e.g., Beta, Gaussian). Use Bayesian updates based on retrieval success/failure. Compose relevance scores probabilistically from multiple query features.
  * Perception/State Representation: Model state variables or object properties as distributions (\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)) updated via filtering techniques (Kalman, Particle). Compose complex scene representations from probabilistic object states. Decompose prediction errors to identify surprising sensory inputs.
  * Language Processing: Represent word/sentence embeddings or semantic roles probabilistically (\\mathcal{N}(\\mu\_e, \\Sigma\_e) or VAEs). Use neural composition for deriving sentence meaning distributions. Use decomposition for ambiguity resolution.
  * Emotion/Motivation: Model emotional states or goal utilities/priorities as distributions (e.g., Gaussian over VAD space, Gamma for utility). Compose emotional state from probabilistic appraisals. Decompose complex moods into drivers.
  * Planning/Executive Function: Enable probabilistic planning by composing distributions of sub-goal utilities and success probabilities. Represent plan utility or resource availability probabilistically. Decompose plan failures to assign blame to uncertain sub-goals.
  * Action Selection: Implement distributional RL, representing Q-values or policy probabilities as distributions (Categorical, Quantile). Update value distributions using distributional Bellman equations. Use decomposition to explain action choices based on value distribution properties (mean vs. variance).
  * Social Cognition: Model Theory of Mind variables (beliefs, intents of others) probabilistically, updating via Bayesian inference based on observations.
  * Metacognition: A metacognitive module can directly utilize VALCORE by monitoring uncertainty metrics (entropy, variance) of P(V) across the system. It can consume decomposition outputs to build causal models of system performance, detect conflicts, and guide learning or resource allocation.
* Inter-Module Communication: Requires a mechanism for transmitting probabilistic value information between modules. This could involve:
  * Standardized Data Formats: Defining common structures (like objects or structured messages) to encapsulate distribution types and parameters (e.g., using formats compatible with libraries like TensorFlow Probability or PyTorch Distributions).
  * Message Bus / Blackboard: Utilizing the architecture's existing communication infrastructure, adapted to handle these probabilistic data structures efficiently.
* Interaction with Global Systems:
  * Attention Mechanisms: If the host architecture has global attention, it can modulate VALCORE operations by prioritizing updates for certain P(V) or weighting inputs to composition/decomposition engines based on relevance.
  * Neuromodulation Analogs: If the architecture models neuromodulatory influences (e.g., global signals related to reward prediction error, arousal, or uncertainty), these signals can dynamically adjust parameters within VALCORE's update, composition, or decomposition functions (e.g., modifying learning rates, prior strengths, variance terms).
* Modularity and Flexibility: VALCORE is not all-or-nothing. Specific capabilities (e.g., probabilistic representation in one module, dynamic updates in another) can be integrated incrementally based on the needs and structure of the host architecture.

5. Implementation Strategies and Algorithmic Considerations
Implementing VALCORE requires careful choices:

* 5.1. Data Structures for Probabilistic Values: Leverage libraries like TensorFlow Probability (TFP) or PyTorch Distributions (torch.distributions). These provide objects for various distributions that encapsulate parameters and offer methods for .sample(), .log_prob(), .mean(), .variance(), .entropy(). Custom classes can wrap these for architectural integration.
* 5.2. Neural Network Architectures: Utilize Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), VAEs, Normalizing Flows, GNNs (for graph-structured values), or Transformers (for sequences of distributions) to implement VALCORE functions (f\_{\\text{update}}, f\_{\\text{comp}}, f\_{\\text{decomp}}).
* 5.3. Learning Paradigms: Employ Variational Inference (VI) for models with latent probabilistic representations (e.g., maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO): \\mathcal{L}*{\\text{ELBO}} = \\mathbb{E}*{q(z|X)}[\\log p(X|z)] - KL(q(z|X) || p(z))). Utilize Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms (e.g., C51, QR-DQN, IQN). Employ Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for training composition/decomposition engines (e.g., using distributional similarity losses like KL divergence or Wasserstein distance, or reconstruction objectives). Consider Meta-Learning for adapting VALCORE parameters based on task or environment.
* 5.4. Computational and Algorithmic Challenges: Address efficiency (cost of distributional operations), gradient estimation (reparameterization trick for continuous variables, score function estimators like REINFORCE or Gumbel-Softmax for discrete), numerical stability (positive definite covariances, log-probability ranges), and scalability (managing large numbers of distributional parameters).

6. Evaluation Methodology
Evaluating VALCORE's efficacy involves assessing its components and their impact within the host architecture:

* 6.1. Intrinsic Probabilistic Metrics: Calibration (Expected Calibration Error - ECE), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Proper Scoring Rules (Brier Score, Continuous Ranked Probability Score - CRPS), Distributional Distances (KL Divergence, Wasserstein Distance) if ground truth distributions are known or can be approximated.
* 6.2. Composition/Decomposition Quality Metrics: Reconstruction Fidelity (measure D(P(V\_C) || P(V\_C')) where V\_C' is reconstructed from decomposed components), Component Identifiability (in synthetic tasks with known ground truth), Attribution Faithfulness & Plausibility (using established XAI metrics).
* 6.3. Task-Based Performance: Evaluate the VALCORE-enhanced host architecture on benchmarks requiring reasoning under uncertainty, partial observability, or risk sensitivity (e.g., contextual bandits, probabilistic planning problems). Measure improvements in sample efficiency, robustness to noise, or overall task success rates compared to a non-VALCORE baseline implementation within the same host architecture.
* 6.4. Ablation Studies: Systematically disable or simplify VALCORE mechanisms within the integrated system (e.g., revert to deterministic values) and measure performance degradation on targeted tasks to quantify VALCORE's contribution.
* 6.5. Explainability Evaluation: Assess the quality (clarity, coherence, utility, fidelity) of explanations generated using VALCORE's decomposition mechanisms, potentially through human studies or comparison against model behavior on counterfactual inputs.

7. Discussion

* 7.1. Expected Contributions and Advantages: The VALCORE framework is anticipated to yield several significant advantages when integrated into AI systems: enhanced robustness to noisy or incomplete information; improved adaptability through dynamic value updates; principled intrinsic explainability via value decomposition; nuanced reasoning considering likelihoods and risks; and better credit assignment for learning.
* 7.2. Limitations and Challenges: Substantial challenges remain, including the computational cost and scalability of probabilistic operations; the complexity of learning models that operate on distributions; ensuring the theoretical soundness of learned composition/decomposition functions; the critical choice of appropriate priors and distributional families; potential parameter explosion; and ensuring component identifiability in decomposition.
* 7.3. Broader Impact: VALCORE represents a step towards AI systems with a more flexible "understanding" of value, potentially impacting autonomous systems, complex decision support, robotics, and human-AI interaction where trustworthiness, adaptability, and transparency are paramount.

8. Future Directions
The VALCORE framework opens several avenues for future research:

* Hierarchical and Recursive VALCORE Structures: Applying VALCORE principles recursively for probabilistic meta-values (e.g., P(\\text{Confidence in } P(V))) and multi-level abstraction.
* Causal VALCORE: Integrating causal discovery and inference methods (e.g., Pearl, 2009) with the decomposition engine to learn causal relationships between values.
* Hardware Acceleration: Development of specialized hardware (e.g., analog or neuromorphic probabilistic processing units) for efficient probabilistic computation.
* VALCORE in Embodied and Interactive Agents: Exploring how sensorimotor interaction shapes probabilistic values and enables active perception and learning in embodied systems.
* Hybrid Probabilistic Paradigms: Investigating the integration of alternative uncertainty representation formalisms (e.g., fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory) alongside standard probability theory within VALCORE.
* Meta-Learning VALCORE Structures: Developing methods for the AI system itself to learn optimal representations and operations for value management (e.g., learning the composition function \\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{comp}} itself).
* Formal Verification: Exploring methods for formally verifying the correctness and safety properties of systems employing VALCORE, especially in safety-critical applications.

9. Conclusion
VALCORE offers a novel and comprehensive perspective on managing value within sophisticated AI systems, aiming to transcend the limitations of traditional static and deterministic representations. By systematically incorporating probabilistic modeling, dynamic updates, and explicit mechanisms for value composition and decomposition, the framework holds significant potential for enhancing the adaptability, robustness, reasoning capabilities, and intrinsic explainability of diverse AI systems and cognitive architectures. This paper presents VALCORE as a standalone set of principles and mechanisms, detached from any specific overarching architecture, to facilitate its broad consideration and potential integration across the field. While substantial theoretical, computational, and implementation challenges remain, VALCORE provides a rich conceptual foundation for advancing artificial intelligence towards greater generality and a more nuanced, human-like engagement with value. Its continued development and empirical validation represent a key research direction in artificial intelligence.

Appendices
Appendix A: Detailed Mathematical Formulations
This appendix provides illustrative mathematical details for some of the core probabilistic operations within the VALCORE framework.
A.1. Bayesian Update: Beta-Bernoulli Model for Probabilistic Relevance
Consider a scenario within a hypothetical memory system where the relevance R of a memory item is a binary variable (R=1 for relevant, R=0 for not relevant). The probability of relevance, \\theta\_R = P(R=1), is unknown. VALCORE represents this uncertainty using a Beta distribution for \\theta\_R:
P(\theta_R | \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \text{Beta}(\theta_R; \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha_0 + \beta_0)}{\Gamma(\alpha_0)\Gamma(\beta_0)} \theta_R^{\alpha_0-1} (1-\theta_R)^{\beta_0-1}
where \\alpha\_0, \\beta\_0 are the prior hyperparameters (e.g., from past experience or a non-informative prior like \\alpha\_0=1, \\beta\_0=1).
Suppose new evidence \\mathcal{E} is observed in the form of N independent assessments of relevance for this item, resulting in k instances where the item was deemed relevant and N-k instances where it was not. The likelihood of this evidence given \\theta\_R is a Binomial distribution:
$$P(\mathcal{E} | \theta_R) = \text{Binomial}(k; N, \theta_R) = \binom{N}{k} \theta_R^k (1-\theta_R)^{N-k}$$Due to the conjugacy of the Beta prior and Binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution P(\\theta\_R | \\mathcal{E}, \\alpha\_0, \\beta\_0) is also a Beta distribution:P(\theta_R | \mathcal{E}, \alpha_0, \beta_0) = \text{Beta}(\theta_R; \alpha_N, \beta_N)$$where the updated hyperparameters are:$$\alpha_N = \alpha_0 + k
\beta_N = \beta_0 + (N-k)
The memory system would store and propagate (\\alpha\_N, \\beta\_N) as the parameters of the probabilistic relevance score. The expected relevance is E[\\theta\_R | \\mathcal{E}] = \\frac{\\alpha\_N}{\\alpha\_N + \\beta\_N}, and the confidence can be related to the variance \\text{Var}(\\theta\_R | \\mathcal{E}) = \\frac{\\alpha\_N \\beta\_N}{(\\alpha\_N + \\beta\_N)^2 (\\alpha\_N + \\beta\_N + 1)}. This update is computationally efficient and analytically tractable.
A.2. Composition of Gaussian Distributions: Linear Combination
Consider two independent probabilistic values V\_1 and V\_2 represented by Gaussian distributions:
V_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)
V_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)
Suppose a composite value V\_C is formed by a linear combination V\_C = aV\_1 + bV\_2 + c, where a, b, c are scalar constants (potentially determined by context or a learned function).
The mean of V\_C is:
E[V_C] = E[aV_1 + bV_2 + c] = aE[V_1] + bE[V_2] + c = a\mu_1 + b\mu_2 + cThe variance of V\_C, given independence of V\_1 and V\_2, is:\text{Var}(V_C) = \text{Var}(aV_1 + bV_2 + c) = a^2\text{Var}(V_1) + b^2\text{Var}(V_2) = a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2Thus, the composite value V\_C is also Gaussian:V_C \sim \mathcal{N}(a\mu_1 + b\mu_2 + c, a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2)
If V\_1 and V\_2 are d-dimensional vectors V\_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\vec{\\mu}\_1, \\Sigma\_1) and V\_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\vec{\\mu}*2, \\Sigma\_2), and A, B are matrices, V\_C = AV\_1 + BV\_2 + \\vec{c}.
Then E[V\_C] = A\\vec{\\mu}*1 + B\\vec{\\mu}*2 + \\vec{c}.
If V\_1, V\_2 are independent, \\text{Var}(V\_C) = \\Sigma\_C = A\\Sigma\_1 A^T + B\\Sigma\_2 B^T.
If V\_1, V\_2 are correlated with covariance \\text{Cov}(V\_1, V\_2) = \\Sigma*{12} (and \\text{Cov}(V\_2, V\_1) = \\Sigma*{21} = \\Sigma*{12}^T), then:
\Sigma_C = A\Sigma_1 A^T + B\Sigma_2 B^T + A\Sigma_{12}B^T + B\Sigma_{21}A^T
This illustrates how VALCORE's composition engine would operate on parameters of Gaussian distributions. More complex compositions (non-linear, or with non-Gaussian distributions) might require approximation methods like Monte Carlo sampling, linearization (e.g., for Extended Kalman Filters), or variational approximations.
A.3. Variational Inference Objective (ELBO) for a VAE Representing a Value
Suppose a value V (e.g., a semantic embedding in a language processing module) is modeled by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VAE assumes a generative process P(V, z) = P(V|z; \\theta)P(z), where z is a latent variable with prior P(z) (e.g., \\mathcal{N}(0,I)), and P(V|z; \\theta) is the likelihood function (decoder network with parameters \\theta). The goal is to maximize the marginal likelihood P(V) = \\int P(V|z; \\theta)P(z) dz.
Since computing P(V|X) (where X is the input conditioning V, e.g. a word) involves an intractable posterior P(z|V,X), VI introduces an approximate posterior q(z|V,X; \\phi) (encoder network with parameters \\phi).
The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), \\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi; V,X), is maximized:
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; V,X) = E_{q(z|V,X; \phi)}[\log P(V|z; \theta)] - KL(q(z|V,X; \phi) || P(z))
The first term is the reconstruction likelihood: it encourages the decoder to accurately reconstruct V from latent samples z drawn from the approximate posterior. The second term is a regularization term that encourages the approximate posterior to be close to the prior P(z).
The parameters of q(z|V,X; \\phi) (e.g., mean and variance if q is Gaussian) are themselves probabilistic representations within VALCORE, representing uncertainty over the latent encoding of V. The output P(V|z; \\theta) (e.g., a Gaussian distribution over embeddings, \\mathcal{N}(\\mu\_V(z), \\Sigma\_V(z))) is another VALCORE probabilistic value.
Appendix B: Pseudocode for Core VALCORE Operations
