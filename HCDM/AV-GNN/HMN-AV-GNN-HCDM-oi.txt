HMN-AV-GNN within HCDM-oi
The HMN-AV-GNN could fit into HCDM-oi in several compelling ways:
As a Hybrid Module Core: The HMN-AV-GNN could form the digital backbone of modules like the hDSSM or hEMM. Its dynamic graph structure (AV-GNN) could represent evolving state spaces or memory associations, while its HMN neurons handle the digital-side processing and learning rules. The organoid would provide the z_t_bio â€“ the rich, low-power, associative dynamics that the HMN nodes integrate. The AV-GNN's branching/pruning could even be informed by organoid activity, and its plasticity rules (HMN) could help train the BDIM encoder/decoder.
As an Executive/Routing Model: The HMN-AV-GNN, with its focus on decision pathways, could serve as a model for the Dynamic Attention Routing (DAR) or part of the Executive Function Module (EFM). It could learn to navigate the "decision space" of how to route information between digital modules and the organoid, based on task needs and the Organoid State Module (OSM) feedback.
As a Bio-Digital Interaction Model: The principles of HMN (plasticity, attention, neuromodulation) could be the language used by the BDIM to "talk" to the organoid. The encoder could translate digital commands into HMN-like stimulus patterns (multi-timescale, phase-locked), and the decoder could interpret organoid activity through an HMN-like lens.
As a Model for Organoid Development/Plasticity: The AV-GNN's growth rules could model or even attempt to guide (via BDIM stimulation) the structural development and long-term plasticity within the organoid itself, aiming to shape its computational capabilities.
