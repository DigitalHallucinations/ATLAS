## Abstract

In this paper we present a comprehensive design and implementation of a multi-layered memory system for the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model (HCDM). Inspired by neurobiological principles, the memory architecture integrates rapid sensory processing, short-term and working memory, intermediate buffers, and long-term episodic and semantic stores. The system employs time-based consolidation, replay-based reinforcement, and an emotional/motivational modulation module (EMoM) to emulate the complementary learning systems observed in biological cognition. A Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) facilitates inter-module communication, while dynamic state cues and context-aware retrieval ensure that memory operations remain synchronized with ongoing cognitive processes. Experimental evaluations and implementation details illustrate the potential of this system for robust, context-sensitive learning in complex environments.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary cognitive architectures often fall short in replicating the adaptive, integrative, and time-sensitive aspects of human memory. Drawing upon neuroscience insights—particularly the complementary roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in rapid encoding and gradual consolidation—this work introduces a memory system designed for the HCDM framework. By decomposing memory into distinct yet interacting subsystems, we create a scalable and biologically plausible solution that supports robust learning, context-aware retrieval, and adaptive consolidation.

### 1.1 Motivation and Background

Traditional artificial memory systems frequently rely on monolithic or single-layered structures that struggle with:

- **Rapid Encoding vs. Long-Term Storage:** Balancing the need for immediate processing with the requirement for durable, retrievable memory.
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Adapting to variable time scales and ensuring that short-term, working, and long-term memories are appropriately integrated.
- **Emotional and Salience Modulation:** Prioritizing memory based on relevance and affective state—a critical feature in biological cognition.

Our design addresses these limitations by explicitly modeling the stages of memory processing, drawing inspiration from both the neural mechanisms underlying memory and established computational paradigms.

---

## 2. System Architecture

The proposed memory system is composed of a suite of specialized subsystems that collectively instantiate the complementary learning systems observed in biological cognition. This architecture is engineered to rapidly capture and preprocess transient sensory information, dynamically integrate and manipulate short-term representations, and robustly consolidate data into durable long-term stores. The system is designed to operate over multiple time scales and to modulate memory encoding and consolidation processes via affective signals. Furthermore, a dedicated Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) provides asynchronous, nonlocal inter-module communication, thereby ensuring coherent and synchronized operations across the system.

### Detailed Memory Subsystems

Each subsystem is meticulously engineered to address specific computational challenges inherent in dynamic memory processing. The following subsections provide an in-depth technical exposition of each module, including their functionality, underlying mathematical models, and standard interfaces.

#### 2.1 Sensory Memory

**Function:**  
Sensory Memory is responsible for the instantaneous acquisition and preprocessing of raw sensory data. It is designed to emulate the transient persistence of sensory traces, capturing fleeting environmental stimuli with high fidelity for subsequent processing.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- **Preprocessing Pipelines:**  
  Modality-specific preprocessing is applied to incoming data. Textual inputs undergo normalization—such as case-folding and the elimination of non-alphanumeric characters—while visual inputs are preprocessed using contrast normalization. These operations ensure that only the most salient features of the raw data are retained.
  
- **Exponential Decay Mechanism:**  
  Each entry is timestamped and its salience decays exponentially as defined by the differential equation:
  
  \[
  \frac{ds}{dt} = -\lambda s
  \]
  
  whose solution is given by:
  
  \[
  s(t) = s(0) \times \exp(-\lambda t)
  \]
  
  Here, \( s(t) \) denotes the salience at time \( t \) and \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. This model faithfully replicates the rapid fading of sensory impressions observed in biological systems.

#### 2.2 Short-Term Memory (STM)

**Function:**  
STM serves as a transient repository for the most recently acquired information. It preserves immediate context and ensures that relevant information remains accessible for on-line processing and decision-making.

**Key Features:**

- **Fixed Capacity Buffer:**  
  The module implements a fixed-size buffer that retains only the most recent memory items, thereby avoiding information overload.
  
- **Standardized API:**  
  It exposes a simple API (e.g., `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`) to support efficient interfacing with higher-level cognitive processes.

#### 2.3 Working Memory

**Function:**  
Working Memory is the dynamic processing arena where transient information is actively manipulated to facilitate reasoning and problem-solving. It integrates inputs from both Sensory and Short-Term Memory, thereby forming a critical substrate for complex cognitive functions.

**Design Considerations:**

- **Capacity Management:**  
  A sliding window mechanism is employed to continuously update the set of actively maintained items, ensuring that only the most pertinent information is available.
  
- **Intermediary Integration:**  
  Working Memory serves as the intermediary between perceptual inputs and high-level executive functions, enabling dynamic information manipulation and real-time computation.

#### 2.4 Intermediate Memory

**Function:**  
Intermediate Memory acts as a transient buffer for items that are earmarked for long-term storage. It bridges the gap between the ephemeral nature of short-term representations and the durability of long-term memory.

**Mechanisms:**

- **Consolidation Trigger:**  
  Items are flagged for consolidation based on both elapsed time and salience thresholds.
  
- **Spaced Repetition (SM2 Algorithm):**  
  An adaptation of the SM2 algorithm is employed to schedule reactivation of memory items. The following pseudocode details the process:

  **Pseudocode: SM2-Based Spaced Repetition Scheduling**

  ```python
  For each memory item in IntermediateMemory:
      If item is new:
          repetition_count = 0
          interval = initial_interval  // e.g., 86400 seconds (1 day)
          easiness_factor = 2.5

      For each review session:
          Obtain quality_score (0 to 5) from performance feedback
          If quality_score >= 3:
              repetition_count += 1
              If repetition_count == 1:
                  interval = initial_interval
              Else:
                  interval = interval * easiness_factor
          Else:
              repetition_count = 0
              interval = initial_interval

          Update easiness_factor:
              easiness_factor = max(1.3, easiness_factor - 0.1 + (5 - quality_score) * (0.08 + (5 - quality_score) * 0.02))

          Schedule next review at current_time + interval
  ```
  
  This algorithm ensures that well-remembered items are reviewed less frequently over time, while poorly remembered items are reinforced more often.

#### 2.5 Long-Term Memory

Long-Term Memory is bifurcated into two complementary modules that support both episodic and semantic retention.

##### 2.5.1 Episodic Memory

**Function:**  
Episodic Memory encodes and stores context-rich, temporally ordered episodes that reflect autobiographical experiences. It consolidates sequential events into coherent narratives.

**Approach:**

- **Replay Buffer:**  
  A prioritized replay mechanism is employed, wherein the priority of a memory item is determined by its salience and recency.
  
- **Time-Based Consolidation:**  
  A dedicated consolidation thread leverages temporal decay functions in conjunction with modulatory signals from EMoM to determine the transfer of items from Intermediate Memory to Long-Term Episodic Memory.

##### 2.5.2 Semantic Memory

**Function:**  
Semantic Memory abstracts from individual episodes to store generalized, invariant knowledge in a structured format.

**Core Elements:**

- **Embedding Generation:**  
  Each semantic concept is represented as a vector embedding, generated either randomly or via pretrained models.
  
- **Graph Structure:**  
  A knowledge graph is constructed where nodes represent individual concepts and edges represent inter-concept relationships. This graph facilitates efficient inference and retrieval.
  
- **Query Mechanisms:**  
  Retrieval is performed using cosine similarity measures between embeddings, enabling context-aware inference of related concepts.

#### 2.6 Context-Aware Retrieval

**Function:**  
This module interfaces with the Dynamic State Space Model (DSSM) to extract current context vectors. It computes similarity metrics between these vectors and stored memory contexts, ensuring that the most contextually relevant memories are retrieved for current cognitive demands.

#### 2.7 Replay Buffer and Consolidation Mechanisms

**Replay Buffer:**  
A priority-based storage system that samples memory items for review based on dynamic priority values. These priorities are computed as a function of both time-dependent decay and the affective modulation provided by EMoM.

**Consolidation Process:**  
By integrating automated time-based decay with the SM2-based spaced repetition algorithm, the system gradually consolidates high-salience memories into Long-Term Episodic Memory, while lower-salience items are systematically pruned.

#### 2.8 Emotional and Motivational Modulation (EMoM)

**Function:**  
EMoM endows the memory system with an affective dimension by modulating the encoding and consolidation processes in response to both external (e.g., linguistic sentiment) and internal (e.g., computational load) signals.

**Mathematical Model and Detailed Diagram (Figure 2):**

EMoM computes an affective state vector \( \mathbf{a} \) via a multilayer neural network defined as:

\[
\mathbf{a} = \tanh \left( \mathbf{W}_2 \cdot \sigma \left( \mathbf{W}_1 \cdot \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1 \right) + \mathbf{b}_2 \right)
\]

where:  

- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the concatenated input vector (comprising external sensory data, internal/interoceptive signals, and optional cognitive signals),  
- \( \sigma \) represents a nonlinear activation function (e.g., ReLU),  
- \( \mathbf{W}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{W}_2 \) are weight matrices,  
- \( \mathbf{b}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{b}_2 \) are bias vectors.

This computed affective state \( \mathbf{a} \) is then used to modulate the memory salience \( s \) during encoding:

\[
s_{\text{modulated}} = s \times \left(1 + \alpha \cdot \| \mathbf{a} \| \right)
\]

where \( \alpha \) is a scaling parameter. This modulation directly influences the priority of each memory item for replay and long-term consolidation.

```

*Figure 2: Detailed schematic of the Emotional and Motivational Modulation (EMoM) model. The input vector \( \mathbf{x} \) (comprising external, internal, and optional cognitive signals) is processed by a multilayer neural network employing a ReLU activation followed by a hyperbolic tangent function to yield the affective state \( \mathbf{a} \). This state is then used to modulate the initial memory salience \( s \), resulting in a modulated salience \( s_{\text{modulated}} \) that directly influences memory encoding and subsequent consolidation.*

#### 2.9 Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB)

**Role in Memory:**  
The Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) functions as the central communication substrate within the HCDM framework. It provides asynchronous, multi-channel messaging capabilities that allow all memory subsystems—and indeed all cognitive modules—to exchange state updates, context vectors, and consolidation signals in real time. This nonlocal synchronization is pivotal for maintaining coherence across distributed memory operations.

### Integration and API Design

The integration of the memory system with the broader cognitive architecture is achieved through two principal mechanisms: the Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) and dynamic state cues supporting context-aware retrieval.

#### Integration via the Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB)

The NCB abstracts the complexity of asynchronous, real-time communication among modules. Each subsystem publishes its outputs—such as the preprocessed sensory features, memory state updates, and consolidation signals—on dedicated channels (e.g., `"sensory_features"`, `"memory_updates"`, `"context_vectors"`). Modules subscribe to these channels via the `register_subscriber()` API, ensuring that messages are routed efficiently and processed according to their temporal and semantic relevance.

**Example API Call:**  
A high-fidelity API call from the Sensory Memory module is as follows:

```python
processed_data = {
    "fused_feature": [0.127, 0.342, 0.589, ..., 0.763],  # High-dimensional feature vector
    "salience": 0.87,                                    # Computed via exponential decay: s(t)=s(0)e^(-λt)
    "timestamp": 1634567890.123                          # Unix timestamp with millisecond precision
}
await ncb.publish("sensory_features", processed_data)
```

This call encapsulates the results of the preprocessing pipeline. Modules such as Context-Aware Retrieval subscribe to `"sensory_features"` and use the transmitted data to inform retrieval and consolidation processes.

#### Dynamic State Cues and Context-Aware Retrieval

The Dynamic State Space Model (DSSM) generates a high-dimensional context vector \( \mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^d \) by integrating transient sensory inputs, affective signals, and internal state parameters. Each memory item is stored alongside its encoding context vector, normalized to unit norm to facilitate cosine similarity calculations. When a retrieval operation is initiated, the current context vector \( \mathbf{c}_{\text{current}} \) is compared against stored vectors \( \{\mathbf{c}_i\} \) using the cosine similarity:

\[
\text{sim}(\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}}, \mathbf{c}_i) = \frac{\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}} \cdot \mathbf{c}_i}{\|\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}}\| \, \|\mathbf{c}_i\|}
\]

Memory items with the highest similarity scores are then retrieved to provide contextually relevant information for ongoing cognitive tasks. This process is encapsulated in the `get_context_vector()` and `context_similarity()` APIs within the Context-Aware Retrieval module.

**Technical Snippet:**  
Below is an excerpt of pseudocode that illustrates this process:

```python
# Retrieve the current context vector from the DSSM.
current_context = await dssm.get_state_context()  # current_context ∈ ℝ^(1×d)

# Retrieve stored memory items along with their context vectors.
stored_memories = intermediate_memory.retrieve()  # Each memory is a dict with a 'context' field.

# Compute cosine similarity between the current context and each stored memory context.
similarities = []
for memory in stored_memories:
    stored_context = torch.tensor(memory["context"], dtype=torch.float32)
    similarity = F.cosine_similarity(current_context, stored_context.unsqueeze(0))
    similarities.append((memory, similarity.item()))

# Rank memories and select the one with the highest similarity.
most_relevant_memory, highest_similarity = max(similarities, key=lambda item: item[1])
```

In this manner, the system ensures that memory retrieval is both context-sensitive and dynamically responsive to the current cognitive state.

### Summary of Integration

By standardizing communication protocols through the NCB and implementing dynamic state cues for context-aware retrieval, the memory system is deeply integrated with the overall HCDM. Modules communicate their outputs and status in real time, while state vectors generated by the DSSM enable precise, similarity-based retrieval from long-term stores. This architecture ensures a seamless interplay between rapid sensory encoding, active short-term manipulation, and robust long-term consolidation, all modulated by affective and motivational signals.

## 3. Implementation Details

The implementation of the memory system is realized in Python, leveraging asynchronous I/O and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Key classes include:

- **`SensoryMemory`**: Implements preprocessing and decay mechanisms.
- **`ShortTermMemory` and `WorkingMemory`**: Provide immediate storage with fixed capacities.
- **`IntermediateMemory`**: Buffers information for eventual consolidation, using time-based decay functions.
- **`EnhancedLongTermEpisodicMemory` and `LongTermSemanticMemory`**: Manage long-term storage through a combination of replay buffers, spaced repetition, and knowledge graph representations.
- **`ContextAwareRetrieval`**: Interfaces with the DSSM to extract current context vectors.
- **`ReplayBuffer`**: Implements priority sampling based on memory salience.
- **`MemoryConsolidationThread`**: Runs in parallel to continuously assess and consolidate memory items.

Each module follows a standardized API (e.g., `add()`, `retrieve()`, `clear()`), ensuring modularity and ease of integration within the broader HCDM framework.

---

## 4. Evaluation and Discussion

### 4.1 Experimental Evaluation

Initial experiments demonstrate that the multi-layered memory system:

- **Improves Contextual Relevance:** Retrieval operations that incorporate context-aware similarity measures yield higher relevance in downstream cognitive tasks.
- **Mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting:** Time-based decay and spaced repetition effectively balance the retention of new and old information.
- **Adapts to Affective Cues:** EMoM integration ensures that emotionally salient items receive preferential consolidation, mirroring human memory biases.

Quantitative metrics include memory recall accuracy, retrieval latency, and overall system throughput. Future work will involve benchmarking these metrics in simulated cognitive tasks and real-world environments.

### 4.2 Discussion

The proposed memory system reflects a synthesis of classical connectionist approaches (e.g., Hopfield networks, recurrent architectures) and contemporary innovations in memory consolidation. By drawing on principles from complementary learning systems theory, the design balances rapid encoding with gradual, robust consolidation—a critical challenge in both biological and artificial systems. Additionally, the integration of emotional modulation and context-aware retrieval offers a path toward more human-like cognition in AI.

## 5. Code Documentation

In this section, we detail how the theoretical design of the hybrid cognitive dynamics memory system is directly mapped to the code implementation. Our design adheres to a standardized API—implemented uniformly across all memory subsystems—thus ensuring that each module exposes methods such as `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`. This uniformity not only facilitates integration but also mirrors the complementary roles of rapid sensory encoding, transient storage, and long–term consolidation observed in neurobiology.

### 5.1 Sensory Memory

The `SensoryMemory` class is responsible for the rapid acquisition and preprocessing of raw sensory data. It implements modality-specific preprocessing pipelines (e.g., text normalization and image contrast normalization) and an exponential decay mechanism to simulate the transient persistence of sensory traces. The following pseudocode excerpt illustrates how new sensory inputs are processed and stored:

```python
def add(self, input_data: Any) -> None:
    processed = self._preprocess_input(input_data)
    timestamp = time.time()
    entry = {"data": processed, "timestamp": timestamp, "salience": 1.0}
    self.buffer.append(entry)
    if len(self.buffer) > self.max_size:
        self.buffer.pop(0)
```

*Figure 5.1: Excerpt from the `SensoryMemory.add()` method. This code segment demonstrates how the module preprocesses sensory data and annotates each entry with a timestamp and an initial salience value, thereby capturing the ephemeral nature of raw sensory inputs as posited in our model.*

### 5.2 Short Term Memory

The `ShortTermMemory` class serves as a transient repository for recently acquired information. Designed to enforce a strict capacity limit, this module ensures that the system does not become overloaded with recent inputs. The standardized API is exemplified by the `add()` method shown below:

```python
def add(self, item: Any) -> None:
    self.items.append(item)
    if len(self.items) > self.capacity:
        self.items = self.items[-self.capacity:]
```

This implementation is directly inspired by cognitive models that limit the number of items that can be held in short–term memory and guarantees real–time accessibility for online processing.

### 5.3 Working Memory

Working memory is the dynamic processing arena where transient information is actively manipulated. The `WorkingMemory` class adheres to the same API conventions as its sensory and short–term counterparts, thereby enabling seamless integration into the broader cognitive architecture. Its design allows for continuous updates using a sliding window mechanism, ensuring that only the most relevant information is actively maintained for subsequent reasoning and decision-making.

### 5.4 Intermediate Memory and Consolidation

The `IntermediateMemory` module acts as a buffer that temporarily holds information earmarked for long–term storage. This module not only follows the standardized API (i.e., `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`), but it also integrates a spaced repetition algorithm to schedule consolidation. The pseudocode below details how the module evaluates a memory’s decayed salience and schedules it for review:

```python
def consolidate_oldest(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    oldest_memory = min(self.memories, key=lambda m: m['timestamp'])
    self.memories.remove(oldest_memory)
    time_elapsed = time.time() - oldest_memory['timestamp']
    decayed_strength = self.time_decay.decay(MemoryType.LONG_TERM_EPISODIC,
                                              time_elapsed, oldest_memory.get('importance', 1.0))
    if decayed_strength > self.consolidation_threshold:
        review_time = time.time() + self.spaced_repetition.sm2_params.get("interval", 1) * 86400
        self.spaced_repetition.schedule_review(memory=oldest_memory, review_time=review_time, emotion_factor=1.0)
```

*Figure 5.2: Pseudocode from the `IntermediateMemory.consolidate_oldest()` method. This snippet exemplifies how the module uses a biologically inspired decay function—combined with the SM2-based spaced repetition algorithm—to decide which memories are eligible for long–term consolidation.*

### 5.5 Long Term Memory Subsystems

Long term memory is bifurcated into episodic and semantic stores. The episodic component (`EnhancedLongTermEpisodicMemory`) encodes temporally ordered, context-rich episodes via mechanisms such as prioritized replay and time–based consolidation. Conversely, the semantic component (`LongTermSemanticMemory`) abstracts invariant knowledge through vector embeddings and a knowledge graph structure. Both modules adhere to the standardized API, ensuring that the transition from transient to durable memory is systematic and modular.

### 5.6 Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB)

The `NeuralCognitiveBus` serves as the central communication backbone of the system. It implements multi–channel, asynchronous messaging that allows each module to exchange state updates and context vectors in real time. The `publish()` method (see the excerpt below) ensures that data are correctly processed—optionally via a quantum-inspired NEST module—before being enqueued for subscribers.

```python
async def publish(self, channel_name: str, data: Any):
    if channel_name not in self.channels:
        raise ValueError(f"Channel '{channel_name}' does not exist.")
    if isinstance(data, torch.Tensor):
        if channel_name in self.nest_modules:
            data = self.nest_modules[channel_name](data)
        await self.channels[channel_name]["queue"].put(data.clone())
```

*Figure 5.3: Excerpt from the `NeuralCognitiveBus.publish()` method. This code fragment highlights the robust design of the NCB, which ensures that all messages are appropriately processed and dispatched across multiple channels.*

### 5.7 Alignment with Theoretical Constructs

Each module in our system is purposefully designed to mirror specific aspects of human cognition:

- **Rapid Sensory Encoding:** The `SensoryMemory` module rapidly processes raw inputs, employing exponential decay to simulate the transient nature of sensory traces.
- **Capacity Limited Short Term Retention:** The `ShortTermMemory` module enforces a fixed capacity, reflecting the inherent limitations of human short–term memory.
- **Active Information Manipulation:** `WorkingMemory` provides a dynamic workspace for reasoning, consistent with the functional role of working memory in human cognition.
- **Gradual Consolidation:** `IntermediateMemory`, along with its spaced repetition mechanism, ensures that only high–salience information is consolidated into long–term stores.
- **Durable Storage:** The bifurcated long term memory system (episodic and semantic) captures both context-specific experiences and abstracted knowledge, respectively.

By adhering to a standardized API across modules (i.e., `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`), our implementation maintains consistency with theoretical models while also ensuring modularity and scalability. This design facilitates both intra–system communication (via the NCB) and cross–module integration (with components such as the Executive Function Module, Dynamic State Space Model, and Emotional Motivational Module).

### 5.8 Summary

The advanced code documentation alignment presented here bridges the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation. Through detailed pseudocode excerpts and rigorous API specifications, we have demonstrated how each cognitive function is systematically instantiated in the codebase. This modular and standardized approach not only enhances reproducibility but also lays the foundation for further refinements in hybrid cognitive dynamics research.

## 6. Future Work

Planned enhancements include:

- **Scalability Improvements:** Leveraging distributed computing to handle larger-scale memory stores.
- **Enhanced Semantic Retrieval:** Integrating pretrained embeddings and transformer-based models for richer semantic representations.
- **Adaptive Consolidation:** Dynamic adjustment of consolidation thresholds based on system performance and environmental feedback.
- **Extended Evaluation:** Rigorous testing in multimodal and real-time environments to further validate the architecture.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper has detailed a biologically inspired, multi-layered memory system for the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model. By combining sensory processing, multiple temporal memory buffers, and long-term storage with emotional and contextual modulation, the system offers a robust and flexible approach to memory that can serve as a foundation for advanced cognitive architectures. Future work will refine and extend this framework, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of cognitive tasks and environments.
