## Abstract

In this paper we present a comprehensive design and implementation of a multi-layered memory system for the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model (HCDM). Inspired by neurobiological principles—including recent evidence that human medial temporal lobe (MTL) neurons encode concepts in a context-invariant manner (Rey et al., 2024)—we propose an architecture that integrates rapid sensory processing, short-term and working memory, intermediate buffers, and long-term episodic and semantic stores. The system employs time-based consolidation, replay-based reinforcement, and an emotional/motivational modulation module (EMoM) to emulate the complementary learning systems observed in biological cognition. A Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) facilitates inter-module communication, while dynamic state cues and context-aware retrieval ensure that memory operations remain synchronized with ongoing cognitive processes. Notably, our design separates core concept information from contextual details—mirroring the finding that single neurons code for concepts independent of context—thereby enabling robust, flexible recall. Experimental evaluations and implementation details illustrate the potential of this system for context-sensitive yet conceptually invariant learning in complex environments.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary cognitive architectures often fall short in replicating the adaptive, integrative, and time-sensitive aspects of human memory. Drawing upon neuroscience insights—particularly the complementary roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in rapid encoding and gradual consolidation—this work introduces a memory system designed for the HCDM framework.

A key inspiration for our updated design comes from recent single-neuron recording studies in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL), which reveal that neurons encoding specific concepts (e.g., a famous actor or landmark) do so in a **context-invariant** manner (Rey et al., 2024). In other words, the neuronal response remains largely unchanged across different episodic contexts. This finding suggests that rather than modifying the fundamental representation of a concept based on context, the brain may store the core “information” independently while associating distinct contexts separately.

By decomposing memory into distinct yet interacting subsystems, our updated design creates a scalable and biologically plausible solution that supports robust learning, context-aware retrieval, and adaptive consolidation—all while maintaining invariant conceptual representations.

### 1.1 Motivation and Background

Traditional artificial memory systems frequently rely on monolithic or single-layered structures that struggle with:

- **Rapid Encoding vs. Long-Term Storage:** Balancing the need for immediate processing with the requirement for durable, retrievable memory.
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Adapting to variable time scales and ensuring that short-term, working, and long-term memories are appropriately integrated.
- **Emotional and Salience Modulation:** Prioritizing memory based on relevance and affective state—a critical feature in biological cognition.
- **Contextual Separation:** Many conventional models entangle context with the core information. In contrast, recent evidence from human MTL recordings (Rey et al., 2024) shows that memory coding can be context-invariant—a design principle we incorporate to allow the separation of concept from context.

Our design addresses these limitations by explicitly modeling the stages of memory processing, drawing inspiration from both the neural mechanisms underlying memory and established computational paradigms.

## 2. System Architecture

The proposed memory system is composed of a suite of specialized subsystems that collectively instantiate the complementary learning systems observed in biological cognition. Engineered to operate over multiple time scales, the system rapidly captures and preprocesses transient sensory information, dynamically integrates short-term representations, and robustly consolidates data into durable long-term stores.

Critically, our architecture distinguishes between the **core concept representation** and its associated episodic context. This design choice is informed by findings that human MTL neurons exhibit context-invariant coding (Rey et al., 2024). In our system, **Semantic Memory** encodes and stores invariant, context–free concepts, while **Episodic Memory** captures the specific contextual details of each experience. Context thus acts as a retrieval filter rather than as an intrinsic modifier of the concept representation.

The diagram delineates the progression from raw sensory input through successive memory buffers—Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, Working Memory, and Intermediate Memory—to the consolidation of long-term memory into Episodic and Semantic components. The figure emphasizes that while episodic memory stores context-rich episodes, semantic memory holds context–invariant concept representations. The Emotional/Motivational Module (EMoM) modulates processing, and the Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) provides asynchronous inter-module communication.*

### Detailed Memory Subsystems

Each subsystem is meticulously engineered to address specific computational challenges inherent in dynamic memory processing. The following subsections provide an in-depth technical exposition of each module, including their functionality, underlying mathematical models, and standard interfaces.

#### 2.1 Sensory Memory

**Function:**  
Sensory Memory is responsible for the instantaneous acquisition and preprocessing of raw sensory data. It is designed to emulate the transient persistence of sensory traces, capturing fleeting environmental stimuli with high fidelity for subsequent processing.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- **Preprocessing Pipelines:**  
  Modality-specific preprocessing is applied to incoming data. Textual inputs undergo normalization—such as case-folding and the elimination of non-alphanumeric characters—while visual inputs are preprocessed using contrast normalization. These operations ensure that only the most salient features of the raw data are retained.
  
- **Exponential Decay Mechanism:**  
  Each entry is timestamped and its salience decays exponentially as defined by the differential equation:
  
  \[
  \frac{ds}{dt} = -\lambda s
  \]
  
  whose solution is given by:
  
  \[
  s(t) = s(0) \times \exp(-\lambda t)
  \]
  
  Here, \( s(t) \) denotes the salience at time \( t \) and \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. This model faithfully replicates the rapid fading of sensory impressions observed in biological systems.

#### 2.2 Short-Term Memory (STM)

**Function:**  
STM serves as a transient repository for the most recently acquired information. It preserves immediate context and ensures that relevant information remains accessible for on-line processing and decision-making.

**Key Features:**

- **Fixed Capacity Buffer:**  
  The module implements a fixed-size buffer that retains only the most recent memory items, thereby avoiding information overload.
  
- **Standardized API:**  
  It exposes a simple API (e.g., `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`) to support efficient interfacing with higher-level cognitive processes.

#### 2.3 Working Memory

**Function:**  
Working Memory is the dynamic processing arena where transient information is actively manipulated to facilitate reasoning and problem-solving. It integrates inputs from both Sensory and Short-Term Memory, forming a critical substrate for complex cognitive functions.

**Design Considerations:**

- **Capacity Management:**  
  A sliding window mechanism is employed to continuously update the set of actively maintained items, ensuring that only the most pertinent information is available.
  
- **Intermediary Integration:**  
  Working Memory serves as the intermediary between perceptual inputs and high-level executive functions, enabling dynamic information manipulation and real-time computation.

#### 2.4 Intermediate Memory

**Function:**  
Intermediate Memory acts as a transient buffer for items that are earmarked for long-term storage. It bridges the gap between the ephemeral nature of short-term representations and the durability of long-term memory.

**Mechanisms:**

- **Consolidation Trigger:**  
  Items are flagged for consolidation based on both elapsed time and salience thresholds.
  
- **Spaced Repetition (SM2 Algorithm):**  
  An adaptation of the SM2 algorithm is employed to schedule reactivation of memory items. The following pseudocode details the process:

  **Pseudocode: SM2-Based Spaced Repetition Scheduling**

  ```python
  For each memory item in IntermediateMemory:
      If item is new:
          repetition_count = 0
          interval = initial_interval  // e.g., 86400 seconds (1 day)
          easiness_factor = 2.5

      For each review session:
          Obtain quality_score (0 to 5) from performance feedback
          If quality_score >= 3:
              repetition_count += 1
              If repetition_count == 1:
                  interval = initial_interval
              Else:
                  interval = interval * easiness_factor
          Else:
              repetition_count = 0
              interval = initial_interval

          Update easiness_factor:
              easiness_factor = max(1.3, easiness_factor - 0.1 + (5 - quality_score) * (0.08 + (5 - quality_score) * 0.02))

          Schedule next review at current_time + interval
  ```
  
  This algorithm ensures that well-remembered items are reviewed less frequently over time, while poorly remembered items are reinforced more often.

#### 2.5 Long-Term Memory

Long-Term Memory is bifurcated into two complementary modules that support both episodic and semantic retention. A key innovation in our updated design is the **explicit separation of context from the core concept**.

##### 2.5.1 Episodic Memory

**Function:**  
Episodic Memory encodes and stores context-rich, temporally ordered episodes that reflect autobiographical experiences. It consolidates sequential events into coherent narratives without altering the invariant concept coding.

**Approach:**

- **Separate Context Storage:**  
  The episodic component stores the details of the context (time, place, emotional state, etc.) alongside the event but does not modify the underlying concept coding. This enables the retrieval of the same core concept across different episodic contexts.
  
- **Replay Buffer:**  
  A prioritized replay mechanism is employed, wherein the priority of a memory item is determined by its salience and recency.
  
- **Time-Based Consolidation:**  
  A dedicated consolidation thread leverages temporal decay functions in conjunction with modulatory signals from EMoM to determine the transfer of items from Intermediate Memory to Long-Term Episodic Memory.

##### 2.5.2 Semantic Memory

**Function:**  
Semantic Memory abstracts from individual episodes to store generalized, invariant knowledge in a structured format. In our design, semantic memory captures the core concept—such as a person or object—independent of any contextual association.

**Core Elements:**

- **Context-Invariant Embedding Generation:**  
  Each semantic concept is represented as a vector embedding generated via pretrained models or learned representations, ensuring that the encoding remains constant regardless of episodic context.
  
- **Graph Structure:**  
  A knowledge graph is constructed where nodes represent individual concepts and edges represent inter-concept relationships. This graph facilitates efficient inference and retrieval.
  
- **Query Mechanisms:**  
  Retrieval is performed using cosine similarity measures between embeddings, enabling context-aware inference of related concepts while leaving the core representation unchanged.

#### 2.6 Context-Aware Retrieval

**Function:**  
This module interfaces with the Dynamic State Space Model (DSSM) to extract current context vectors. It computes similarity metrics between these vectors and stored memory contexts. Importantly, the retrieval process uses context as a filter to access the appropriate episodic associations, while the invariant semantic representations remain intact.

**Implementation:**

- **Similarity-Based Filtering:**  
  When a retrieval operation is initiated, the current context vector \( \mathbf{c}_{\text{current}} \) is compared against stored episodic context vectors using cosine similarity:
  
  \[
  \text{sim}(\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}}, \mathbf{c}_i) = \frac{\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}} \cdot \mathbf{c}_i}{\|\mathbf{c}_{\text{current}}\| \, \|\mathbf{c}_i\|}
  \]
  
- **Decoupled Retrieval:**  
  The semantic memory is queried separately to retrieve the invariant concept, while episodic memory provides the contextual details for that concept.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```python
class ContextAwareRetrieval:
    def __init__(self, episodic_memory):
        self.episodic_memory = episodic_memory

    def retrieve(self, current_context_vector):
        scores = []
        for memory in self.episodic_memory.episodes:
            score = cosine_similarity(current_context_vector, memory["context"])
            scores.append((memory["event"], score))

        # Rank by similarity and return events that pass a threshold.
        scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return [event for event, score in scores if score > 0.7]  # Threshold filtering
```

#### 2.7 Replay Buffer and Consolidation Mechanisms

**Replay Buffer:**  
A priority-based storage system that samples memory items for review based on dynamic priority values. These priorities are computed as a function of both time-dependent decay and the affective modulation provided by EMoM.

**Consolidation Process:**  
By integrating automated time-based decay with the SM2-based spaced repetition algorithm, the system gradually consolidates high-salience memories into Long-Term Episodic Memory, while lower-salience items are systematically pruned. Importantly, the consolidation process respects the decoupling of context and core concept; that is, the invariant semantic representation is never altered by episodic details.

#### 2.8 Emotional and Motivational Modulation (EMoM)

**Function:**  
EMoM endows the memory system with an affective dimension by modulating the encoding and consolidation processes in response to both external (e.g., linguistic sentiment) and internal (e.g., computational load) signals.

**Mathematical Model and Detailed Diagram (Figure 2):**

EMoM computes an affective state vector \( \mathbf{a} \) via a multilayer neural network defined as:

\[
\mathbf{a} = \tanh \left( \mathbf{W}_2 \cdot \sigma \left( \mathbf{W}_1 \cdot \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1 \right) + \mathbf{b}_2 \right)
\]

where:  

- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the concatenated input vector (comprising external sensory data, internal/interoceptive signals, and optional cognitive signals),  
- \( \sigma \) represents a nonlinear activation function (e.g., ReLU),  
- \( \mathbf{W}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{W}_2 \) are weight matrices,  
- \( \mathbf{b}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{b}_2 \) are bias vectors.

This computed affective state \( \mathbf{a} \) is then used to modulate the memory salience \( s \) during encoding:

\[
s_{\text{modulated}} = s \times \left(1 + \alpha \cdot \| \mathbf{a} \| \right)
\]

where \( \alpha \) is a scaling parameter. This modulation directly influences the priority of each memory item for replay and long-term consolidation.

```

*Figure 2: Detailed schematic of the Emotional and Motivational Modulation (EMoM) model. The input vector \( \mathbf{x} \) (comprising external, internal, and optional cognitive signals) is processed by a multilayer neural network employing a ReLU activation followed by a hyperbolic tangent function to yield the affective state \( \mathbf{a} \). This state is then used to modulate the initial memory salience \( s \), resulting in a modulated salience \( s_{\text{modulated}} \) that directly influences memory encoding and subsequent consolidation.*

#### 2.9 Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB)

**Role in Memory:**  
The Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB) functions as the central communication substrate within the HCDM framework. It provides asynchronous, multi-channel messaging capabilities that allow all memory subsystems—and indeed all cognitive modules—to exchange state updates, context vectors, and consolidation signals in real time.

**Context-Invariant Messaging:**  
In line with our principle of context-invariant concept representation, the NCB routes “pure” concept signals (for semantic storage) separately from episodic events that include context. For example:

- A message publishing a visual stimulus’s processing outcome will include an invariant feature vector sent to Semantic Memory.
- A separate message, including contextual tags (e.g., time, location), is sent to Episodic Memory.

**Example API Call:**

```python
# Publish invariant concept representation.
await ncb.publish("semantic_store", {
    "concept": "Jackie Chan",
    "embedding": concept_vector  # Context-independent vector.
})

# Publish episodic event with contextual details.
await ncb.publish("episodic_store", {
    "event": "Encountered Jackie Chan at Iguazu Falls",
    "context": ["Iguazu Falls", "Christmas"]
})
```

This separation ensures that retrieval can later use context to filter episodes while leaving the core semantic representation unchanged.

## 3. Implementation Details

The implementation of the memory system is realized in Python, leveraging asynchronous I/O and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Key classes include:

- **`SensoryMemory`**: Implements preprocessing and decay mechanisms.
- **`ShortTermMemory` and `WorkingMemory`**: Provide immediate storage with fixed capacities.
- **`IntermediateMemory`**: Buffers information for eventual consolidation, using time-based decay functions and a spaced repetition algorithm.
- **`EnhancedLongTermEpisodicMemory` and `LongTermSemanticMemory`**: Manage long-term storage through a combination of replay buffers, spaced repetition, and a knowledge graph representation—explicitly separating context (episodic) from invariant concept representations (semantic).
- **`ContextAwareRetrieval`**: Interfaces with the DSSM to extract current context vectors and performs similarity-based filtering.
- **`ReplayBuffer`**: Implements priority sampling based on memory salience.
- **`MemoryConsolidationThread`**: Runs in parallel to continuously assess and consolidate memory items.

Each module follows a standardized API (e.g., `add()`, `retrieve()`, `clear()`), ensuring modularity and ease of integration within the broader HCDM framework.

---

## 4. Evaluation and Discussion

### 4.1 Experimental Evaluation

Initial experiments demonstrate that the multi-layered memory system:

- **Improves Contextual Relevance:**  
  Retrieval operations that incorporate context-aware similarity measures yield higher relevance in downstream cognitive tasks, while invariant semantic representations remain stable across contexts.
- **Mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting:**  
  Time-based decay and spaced repetition effectively balance the retention of new and old information.
- **Adapts to Affective Cues:**  
  EMoM integration ensures that emotionally salient items receive preferential consolidation, mirroring human memory biases.
- **Maintains Concept Invariance:**  
  By separating core concept encoding from episodic context, the system retrieves the same semantic representation even when the context changes, echoing findings from human single-neuron recordings (Rey et al., 2024).

Quantitative metrics include memory recall accuracy, retrieval latency, and overall system throughput. Future work will involve benchmarking these metrics in simulated cognitive tasks and real-world environments.

### 4.2 Discussion

The proposed memory system reflects a synthesis of classical connectionist approaches (e.g., Hopfield networks, recurrent architectures) and contemporary innovations in memory consolidation. By drawing on principles from complementary learning systems theory, the design balances rapid encoding with gradual, robust consolidation—a critical challenge in both biological and artificial systems.

Our updated approach—motivated by recent neurobiological findings (Rey et al., 2024)—separates the encoding of core concepts from the contextual details that accompany episodic events. This enables:

- **Stable Semantic Representations:** The invariant encoding of concepts allows for consistent recognition regardless of context.
- **Flexible Episodic Retrieval:** Context acts solely as a retrieval cue, enabling the same concept to be experienced in multiple contexts without redundancy or conflict.
- **Efficient Modular Integration:** With a dedicated Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB), the system ensures that concept representations and episodic details are processed asynchronously yet remain tightly coordinated.

Together, these enhancements offer a pathway toward more human-like cognition in AI, paving the way for future research on adaptive, context-sensitive learning and memory retrieval.

## 5. Code Documentation

In this section, we detail how the theoretical design of the hybrid cognitive dynamics memory system is directly mapped to the code implementation. Our design adheres to a standardized API—implemented uniformly across all memory subsystems—thus ensuring that each module exposes methods such as `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`. This uniformity not only facilitates integration but also mirrors the complementary roles of rapid sensory encoding, transient storage, and long-term consolidation observed in neurobiology.

### 5.1 Sensory Memory

The `SensoryMemory` class is responsible for the rapid acquisition and preprocessing of raw sensory data. It implements modality-specific preprocessing pipelines (e.g., text normalization and image contrast normalization) and an exponential decay mechanism to simulate the transient persistence of sensory traces. The following pseudocode excerpt illustrates how new sensory inputs are processed and stored:

```python
def add(self, input_data: Any) -> None:
    processed = self._preprocess_input(input_data)
    timestamp = time.time()
    entry = {"data": processed, "timestamp": timestamp, "salience": 1.0}
    self.buffer.append(entry)
    if len(self.buffer) > self.max_size:
        self.buffer.pop(0)
```

*Figure 5.1: Excerpt from the `SensoryMemory.add()` method demonstrating how sensory data are preprocessed, timestamped, and assigned an initial salience value.*

### 5.2 Short Term Memory

The `ShortTermMemory` class serves as a transient repository for recently acquired information. Designed to enforce a strict capacity limit, this module ensures that the system does not become overloaded with recent inputs. Its standardized API is exemplified by the `add()` method:

```python
def add(self, item: Any) -> None:
    self.items.append(item)
    if len(self.items) > self.capacity:
        self.items = self.items[-self.capacity:]
```

### 5.3 Working Memory

Working Memory is the dynamic processing arena where transient information is actively manipulated. The `WorkingMemory` class adheres to the same API conventions as its sensory and short-term counterparts, thereby enabling seamless integration into the broader cognitive architecture.

### 5.4 Intermediate Memory and Consolidation

The `IntermediateMemory` module acts as a buffer that temporarily holds information earmarked for long-term storage. This module not only follows the standardized API (i.e., `add()`, `retrieve()`, and `clear()`), but it also integrates a spaced repetition algorithm to schedule consolidation. The pseudocode below details how the module evaluates a memory’s decayed salience and schedules it for review:

```python
def consolidate_oldest(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    oldest_memory = min(self.memories, key=lambda m: m['timestamp'])
    self.memories.remove(oldest_memory)
    time_elapsed = time.time() - oldest_memory['timestamp']
    decayed_strength = self.time_decay.decay(MemoryType.LONG_TERM_EPISODIC,
                                              time_elapsed, oldest_memory.get('importance', 1.0))
    if decayed_strength > self.consolidation_threshold:
        review_time = time.time() + self.spaced_repetition.sm2_params.get("interval", 1) * 86400
        self.spaced_repetition.schedule_review(memory=oldest_memory, review_time=review_time, emotion_factor=1.0)
```

*Figure 5.2: Pseudocode from the `IntermediateMemory.consolidate_oldest()` method, illustrating the use of time-based decay and spaced repetition for scheduling memory consolidation.*

### 5.5 Long Term Memory Subsystems

Long-Term Memory is divided into two parts:

- **Episodic Memory:**  
  The `EnhancedLongTermEpisodicMemory` class stores episodic events along with their associated contextual details. In our design, context is stored separately from the core event (i.e., the invariant concept), allowing for flexible retrieval.
  
  **Example Code:**

  ```python
  class EpisodicMemory:
      def __init__(self):
          self.episodes = []  # List of episodic memories
          self.context_index = {}  # Mapping from context cues to events

      def store_event(self, event, context_vector):
          self.episodes.append({"event": event, "context": context_vector})
          for ctx in context_vector:
              if ctx not in self.context_index:
                  self.context_index[ctx] = []
              self.context_index[ctx].append(event)

      def retrieve_event(self, query_context):
          relevant_events = []
          for ctx in query_context:
              if ctx in self.context_index:
                  relevant_events.extend(self.context_index[ctx])
          return list(set(relevant_events))
  ```
  
- **Semantic Memory:**  
  The `LongTermSemanticMemory` class stores context-invariant concept embeddings. These representations remain constant regardless of episodic context.
  
  **Example Code:**

  ```python
  class SemanticMemory:
      def __init__(self):
          self.concepts = {}  # Dictionary of concept embeddings
          self.associations = {}  # Episodic links to semantic concepts

      def store_concept(self, name, embedding):
          self.concepts[name] = embedding

      def link_episode(self, concept_name, episode):
          if concept_name in self.concepts:
              if concept_name not in self.associations:
                  self.associations[concept_name] = []
              self.associations[concept_name].append(episode)

      def retrieve_concept(self, name):
          return self.concepts.get(name, None)

### 5.6 Neural Cognitive Bus (NCB)

The `NeuralCognitiveBus` serves as the central communication backbone of the system. It implements multi-channel, asynchronous messaging that allows each module to exchange state updates and context vectors in real time. An excerpt from the `publish()` method is shown below:

```python
async def publish(self, channel_name: str, data: Any):
    if channel_name not in self.channels:
        raise ValueError(f"Channel '{channel_name}' does not exist.")
    if isinstance(data, torch.Tensor):
        if channel_name in self.nest_modules:
            data = self.nest_modules[channel_name](data)
        await self.channels[channel_name]["queue"].put(data.clone())
```

### 5.7 Alignment with Theoretical Constructs

Each module in our system is purposefully designed to mirror specific aspects of human cognition:

- **Rapid Sensory Encoding:**  
  The `SensoryMemory` module rapidly processes raw inputs, employing exponential decay to simulate the fleeting nature of sensory traces.
  
- **Capacity-Limited Short-Term Retention:**  
  The `ShortTermMemory` module enforces a fixed capacity, reflecting human short-term memory limitations.
  
- **Active Information Manipulation:**  
  `WorkingMemory` provides a dynamic workspace for reasoning and decision-making.
  
- **Gradual Consolidation with Context Separation:**  
  `IntermediateMemory` and its spaced repetition mechanism ensure that only high-salience information is consolidated into long-term stores. Episodic Memory stores context separately from the invariant semantic representation.
  
- **Durable, Invariant Storage:**  
  The bifurcated Long-Term Memory system captures both episodic details and generalized, context-free semantic representations.

### 5.8 Summary

The advanced code documentation provided here bridges the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation. Through detailed pseudocode excerpts and rigorous API specifications, we have demonstrated how each cognitive function is systematically instantiated in the codebase. The modular and standardized approach—enhanced with a clear separation of context and core concept—facilitates both intra-system communication (via the NCB) and robust memory retrieval.

## 6. Future Work

Planned enhancements include:

- **Scalability Improvements:**  
  Leveraging distributed computing to handle larger-scale memory stores.
- **Enhanced Semantic Retrieval:**  
  Integrating pretrained embeddings and transformer-based models for richer semantic representations.
- **Adaptive Consolidation:**  
  Dynamic adjustment of consolidation thresholds based on system performance and environmental feedback.
- **Extended Evaluation:**  
  Rigorous testing in multimodal and real-time environments to further validate the architecture.
- **Integration with Decision-Making Modules:**  
  Exploring how context-invariant memory representations can be leveraged to improve adaptive reinforcement learning and real-time decision-making.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper has detailed a biologically inspired, multi-layered memory system for the Hybrid Cognitive Dynamics Model. By combining rapid sensory processing, multiple temporal memory buffers, and long-term storage—with a crucial update that decouples invariant semantic representations from episodic context—we offer a robust and flexible approach to memory. The system mimics biological mechanisms by:

- Rapidly encoding sensory data,
- Maintaining capacity-limited short-term representations,
- Dynamically manipulating working memory,
- Consolidating high-salience items through spaced repetition,
- Storing enduring semantic knowledge in a context-invariant manner,
- And retrieving episodic details using context-aware filtering.

These innovations lay the foundation for more human-like cognition in artificial systems. Future work will further refine and extend this framework, ensuring its applicability in a wide range of cognitive tasks and environments.
