# Developer Docs Landing

**Audience:** Contributors building features, extending personas or tools, and maintaining local environments.

**Purpose:** Centralize setup, configuration, and architecture references so developers can provision ATLAS quickly and understand how components fit together before shipping changes.

**When to use this guide:** Use this entry point when you are cloning the repo, configuring providers, validating personas, or integrating new APIs. For production governance or policy review, pivot to the Enterprise docs.
