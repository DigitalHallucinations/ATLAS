## Legend

- **last_audited**: Most recent verification date; parenthetical notes carry forward the last update summary or scope of change.
- **audit_status**: Snapshot of readiness (`Current`, `Needs refresh`, or `Needs overhaul`) mapped from the prior rewrite-needed flags.
- **gaps_found**: Specific drift or missing coverage identified during the last review; use “None noted” when only risk monitoring remains.
- **next_review**: Target date for the next audit based on the documented risk level (High → near-term, Medium → mid-term, Low → extended cadence).
- **notes**: Alignment risk, dependencies, and historical refactor context migrated from legacy inventory fields.
