# Jobs in ATLAS

Jobs orchestrate collections of persona-driven tasks, scheduled runs, and automation policies. These guides explain how job manifests are authored, how lifecycle transitions are recorded, and the APIs that surface scheduling, analytics, and UI workflows. Use the links below to navigate specific areas:

- [Job manifests](manifest.md)
- [Lifecycle events and analytics](lifecycle.md)
- [Service APIs](api.md)
- [Scheduling patterns](scheduling.md)
- [Dashboard and UI workflows](ui.md)

For background on persona tasks that individual jobs depend on, see the [task overview](../tasks/overview.md).
