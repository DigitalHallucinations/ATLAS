# Jobs in ATLAS

Jobs orchestrate collections of persona-driven tasks, scheduled runs, and automation policies. These guides explain how job manifests are authored, how lifecycle transitions are recorded, and the APIs that surface scheduling, analytics, and UI workflows. Use the links below to navigate specific areas:

- [Job manifests](manifest.md) — schema coverage for manifest fields, recurrence, and capability requirements.
- [Lifecycle events and analytics](lifecycle.md) — state machine rules, dependency enforcement, and emitted metrics.
- [Service APIs](api.md) — REST routes mapped to `JobService` operations.
- [Scheduling patterns](scheduling.md) — recurrence metadata, scheduler controls, and monitoring guidance.
- [Dashboard and UI workflows](ui.md) — payload shapes for analytics, schedule state, and linked task rollups.

For background on persona tasks that individual jobs depend on, see the [task overview](../tasks/overview.md).
