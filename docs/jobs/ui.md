# Job dashboards and UI workflows

Dashboards render job and task analytics side-by-side so operators can validate throughput, SLA adherence, and downstream task health. The `CapabilityRegistry.summary` payload now includes an `analytics` section with:

- `tasks`: Output from `get_task_lifecycle_metrics`
- `jobs`: Output from `get_job_lifecycle_metrics`

UI components can:

1. Display persona-aware job queues with status totals and per-job success history.
2. Surface SLA gauges by combining `analytics["jobs"]["sla"]` with schedule metadata.
3. Overlay task completion rates (`analytics["tasks"]`) to highlight dependencies affecting job success.

When users drill into a job, show the recent lifecycle events (with metadata describing schedule runs, SLAs, or linked task counts). Combine these events with task rollups to present a complete funnel from job activation through dependent tasks.

For guidance on rendering persona tasks, refer to the [task overview dashboard section](../tasks/overview.md#ui-and-dashboards). Job-specific UI should reuse those widgets where possible, adding columns for throughput per hour and SLA adherence derived from lifecycle metrics.
