# Assets Directory

Use this folder to store diagrams and other visuals close to the topics they support. Organize assets by doc area (for example, `ui/` for GTK content and `server/` for backend routing diagrams) so contributors can find images without searching the entire tree.

Follow the naming, versioning, and embedding guidance in [`docs/contributing/visual-assets.md`](../contributing/visual-assets.md) when adding or replacing files.
