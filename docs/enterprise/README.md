# Enterprise Docs Landing

**Audience:** Security, compliance, and platform teams responsible for policy enforcement, data governance, and operational resilience.

**Purpose:** Provide a consolidated view of retention rules, access controls, and operational safeguards so enterprise stakeholders can validate ATLAS against organizational requirements.

**When to use this guide:** Begin here when reviewing how ATLAS handles data, credentials, or uptime considerations. For build and customization work, head to the Developer docs; for UI usage, start with the User docs.
