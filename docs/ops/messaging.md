# Messaging Bus Deployment

The ATLAS runtime now routes tool, skill, and analytics events through the
central asynchronous message bus located in `modules/orchestration/message_bus.py`.
The bus supports multiple backends so that local development remains lightweight
while production deployments can switch to a durable Redis Streams cluster.

## Configuration

Message bus settings are controlled by the `messaging` block in
`config.yaml` or via environment variables loaded by `ConfigManager`:

```yaml
messaging:
  backend: in_memory  # or "redis"
  redis_url: redis://localhost:6379/0
  stream_prefix: atlas_bus
```

* `backend` — defaults to `in_memory`. Use `redis` to enable Redis Streams.
* `redis_url` — connection string used when the Redis backend is active. If not
  provided, `ConfigManager` falls back to the `REDIS_URL` environment variable or
  `redis://localhost:6379/0`.
* `stream_prefix` — namespace prefix applied to all stream keys created by the
  bus when using Redis.

Changes take effect on the next application start. The bus is configured during
`ATLAS` initialization via `ConfigManager.configure_message_bus()`.

## Redis Backend Deployment

1. Provision a Redis 6.x (or newer) instance. Redis Streams are required.
2. Secure the deployment with authentication and, if possible, TLS.
3. Expose the connection string as `REDIS_URL` or update the `messaging` block in
   `config.yaml`.
4. Ensure the application host can reach the Redis instance and restart ATLAS.

When Redis is unavailable or the dependency is not installed, ATLAS logs a
warning and automatically falls back to the in-memory backend. In-memory queues
retain events only for the lifetime of the process; prefer Redis for durable or
multi-process scenarios.

## Observability and Tracing

Each message published on the bus includes correlation IDs and tracing metadata
that capture conversation, persona, tool, and skill identifiers. Use these
fields to connect application logs with downstream analytics or monitoring
pipelines when deploying a Redis-backed bus.
