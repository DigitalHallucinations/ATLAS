# User Docs Landing

**Audience:** Operators and workspace members using the ATLAS desktop shell and its built-in workflows.

**Purpose:** Give end users a single entry point to setup guidance, day-to-day flows, and policy reminders without diving into developer or infrastructure specifics.

**When to use this guide:** Start here when you need to install or sign into ATLAS, navigate the UI, or understand how conversations and tasks behave during normal usage. If you are configuring providers or extending personas, jump to the Developer docs instead.
